R-LBS-001,Technical,"Firestore security rules are incorrectly configured, allowing unauthorized client-side writes to the `leaderboards` collection or improperly restricting access, leading to a security vulnerability or functional bugs.",3,5,15,High,"WI-LBS-002, WI-LBS-014",Complexity of the Firebase Rules DSL and potential for human error in translating security requirements into rule logic.,"Mandatory peer review of `firestore.rules` by a developer experienced with Firebase security. Write comprehensive integration tests within the Firebase Emulator Suite specifically targeting security rule violations (e.g., attempting a direct write and asserting failure).","Immediately deploy a restrictive set of rules (e.g., `allow read, write: if false;`) to block all access. Revert to the last known-good version of the rules. Analyze Firestore logs to assess the scope of any unauthorized access.","Integration test for security rules fails. Manual testing reveals an access violation. Unexpected documents appear in the `leaderboards` collection that did not originate from the Cloud Function's service account.",Dev Lead,,
R-LBS-002,Technical,"The rate-limiting logic contains a race condition or flaw that allows a user to bypass the submission limit, potentially leading to leaderboard spam, denial of service, or unexpected high costs from Firestore writes.",2,4,8,Medium,"WI-LBS-012, WI-LBS-011, WI-LBS-014",Incorrect implementation of the Firestore transaction, which is required for atomic read-modify-write operations on the user's submission timestamp document.,"Ensure the logic is strictly contained within a `db.runTransaction` block. Implement specific integration tests that simulate concurrent requests from the same user to verify atomicity and correctness of the limit enforcement.","If abuse is detected, temporarily disable the `submitScore` function. Deploy a hotfix with corrected logic. Set up a GCP budget alert on the Firestore collections to detect cost anomalies.",A spike in writes to the `leaderboards` collection from a single `userId`. Latency alerts on the `submitScore` function due to failing transactions. A budget alert is triggered for Firestore operations.,Dev Lead,,
R-LBS-003,Quality,"Composite indexes are not defined correctly or are missing, causing client-side leaderboard queries to be extremely slow or fail entirely. This directly impacts user experience and core feature functionality.",2,4,8,Medium,"WI-LBS-003, EPIC-LBS-01",Human error in creating the `firestore.indexes.json` file, or the client application attempts a query for which no index exists.,"Deploy indexes to a staging environment and test all expected client-side query patterns against them. The Firebase CLI will warn about missing indexes during local emulation; these warnings should be treated as errors in the CI pipeline.","If a slow query is reported, analyze the query in the Firestore console to identify the missing index. The console provides a one-click way to create the required index. Deploy the updated `firestore.indexes.json` file to make the fix permanent.","Firebase console logs an error for a query requiring an index that does not exist. Client application reports slow leaderboard load times. High read latency alerts for the `leaderboards` collection.",Dev Lead,,
R-LBS-004,Operational,"The CI/CD pipeline, which involves setting up Firebase emulators, running tests, and deploying, is complex and prone to intermittent failures (flakiness), slowing down development velocity and making deployments unreliable.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-LBS-015, WI-LBS-014",The setup and teardown of stateful services like emulators within a stateless CI runner can be complex. Dependencies on external actions or network issues can cause flakiness.,"Use version-pinned, community-vetted GitHub Actions for setting up Java (for emulators), Node, and Firebase. Implement robust retry mechanisms for flaky steps. Ensure emulator startup scripts have readiness checks before tests are run.","Maintain a documented manual deployment process as a fallback. If the pipeline is consistently failing, allocate dedicated time to stabilize it or simplify the testing strategy (e.g., separating unit and integration test jobs).","CI build success rate drops below 90%. Developers frequently report builds failing for non-code-related reasons. Deployment takes significantly longer than the baseline.",DevOps Lead,,
R-LBS-005,Quality,"The score plausibility validation logic is too lenient, allowing cheated scores, or too strict, rejecting legitimate high scores. This undermines the integrity and fairness of the leaderboard.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-LBS-007, WI-LBS-013, BR-LEAD-001",The defined `SCORE_VALIDATION_RULES` are based on assumptions rather than actual gameplay data, and edge cases in scoring logic are not considered.,"Involve the game designer in defining and reviewing the validation rules. Base the rules on theoretical maximums and data from playtesting. Implement extensive unit tests covering a wide range of legitimate and illegitimate score scenarios.","Develop a separate admin-only Cloud Function to manually remove invalid scores from the leaderboard. If a flaw is found, deploy a hotfix with updated rules. Consider a grace period where new rules are logged but not enforced to gather data.","Players report impossible scores on the leaderboard. Analytics show a high rate of score submissions being rejected with plausibility errors. A new legitimate gameplay strategy is blocked by the validator.",Dev Lead,,
R-LBS-006,External,"An outage in a critical Firebase service (Cloud Functions, Firestore, Authentication) renders the leaderboard submission feature completely non-functional.",2,5,10,Medium,"WI-LBS-011, EPIC-LBS-03",Dependency on a third-party cloud provider which is outside of the project team's control.,"Follow best practices for function implementation to allow for graceful failure (e.g., using specified error codes). The client application should be designed to handle backend errors, cache scores locally, and retry submissions later.","Monitor the official Google Cloud / Firebase status page. Use a pre-planned communication channel (e.g., in-app message, social media) to inform users of the outage and its impact. There is no technical contingency other than waiting for the service to be restored.","A sudden spike in 'internal' or 'unavailable' errors from the `submitScore` function. Google Cloud Monitoring alerts for high error rates on Firebase services. Firebase Status Dashboard reports an active incident.",Ops Lead,,
R-LBS-007,Resource,"The development team lacks deep expertise in specific required technologies (e.g., Firestore transactions, advanced Security Rules), leading to implementation delays, suboptimal solutions, or bugs.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-LBS-002, WI-LBS-006, WI-LBS-012",Project requirements necessitate specialized knowledge that may not be evenly distributed across the team.,"Schedule time for proactive knowledge sharing and training sessions on complex topics. Enforce pair programming for critical tasks like security rules and rate-limiting logic. Use official documentation and quick-start guides as a primary reference.","Allocate budget for expert consultation if the team gets stuck on a critical implementation. Allow for extra time in the project schedule for research and development (spikes) on unfamiliar components.","A specific work item is repeatedly delayed or pushed back in sprints. The implemented code for a complex task is overly complicated or does not follow best practices.",Project Manager,,
R-LBS-008,Operational,"Inefficient logic or a bug causes repeated function invocations or excessive database reads/writes, leading to unexpectedly high operational costs on Firebase.",2,4,8,Medium,"WI-LBS-012, WI-LBS-010, WI-LBS-011",Lack of awareness of the Firebase/Firestore cost model during development. A bug causing a retry loop between the client and the function.,"Educate the development team on the Firestore pricing model. Perform cost-modeling for high-traffic functions. Implement strict budget alerts in Google Cloud Platform that trigger notifications at various thresholds.","If a budget alert is triggered, immediately investigate the source of the cost spike using GCP's cost management tools. If necessary, disable the offending function or feature flag it off on the client side until a fix can be deployed.","A budget alert notification is received from Google Cloud. The daily cost report shows an anomalous spike in Firestore operations or Cloud Function invocations.",Ops Lead,,
R-LBS-009,Timeline,"Complexity for high-effort tasks like integration testing, rate-limiting, and CI/CD setup is underestimated, causing delays to the project timeline.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-LBS-012, WI-LBS-014, WI-LBS-015",Optimism bias in estimation for tasks that have multiple complex, interacting components (emulators, cloud services, transactions).,"Break down high-complexity tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Allocate a specific 'spike' or research task before implementation to better understand the complexity. Add a contingency buffer to the schedule for these specific items.","If a task is falling behind, re-prioritize to see if other, simpler tasks can be worked on in parallel. Assign a second developer to pair program and accelerate the work. De-scope non-critical aspects of the feature for a later release if necessary.","The work item exceeds its estimated effort by more than 30% without a clear path to completion. The developer is unable to get the local test environment (emulators) working after a significant period.",Project Manager,,
R-LBS-010,Technical,"A third-party dependency (e.g., `joi`) has a security vulnerability discovered after release, exposing the service to potential exploits.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-LBS-001, WI-LBS-006",Reliance on open-source software, which may have undiscovered vulnerabilities.,"Use automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, GitHub Dependabot) as part of the CI pipeline. Keep dependencies updated to patched versions regularly.","Upon receiving a vulnerability alert, immediately assess its impact on the service. If exploitable, prioritize the update of the dependency, test it, and deploy a hotfix. If a fix is not available, evaluate temporary mitigations or replacing the library.","A high or critical severity vulnerability is reported by `npm audit` or Dependabot for a production dependency.",Dev Lead,,
