RISK-SK-001,Technical,"The .NET Standard 2.1 library may have unforeseen compatibility issues with the specific version of the Unity engine and its IL2CPP/Mono runtime, despite being theoretically compatible.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-SK-1011, Entire project consumption",Discrepancies between the standard .NET implementation and Unity's specific runtime environment for .NET Standard 2.1.,"Create a minimal 'smoke test' Unity project at the very beginning of the project. This project will do nothing but import the compiled `SharedKernel.dll` and attempt to instantiate a simple class to verify successful compilation and runtime execution.","If incompatibilities are found, research the required changes. This may involve changing the target framework, refactoring code to avoid unsupported APIs, or finding Unity-specific workarounds. Allocate budget for research and rework.",The smoke test Unity project fails to build or throws runtime errors when using the library.,Tech Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-002,Quality,"Under schedule pressure, the development of unit tests (EPIC-SK-005) may be rushed or skipped, leading to low test coverage and latent bugs in the foundational code.",4,4,16,High,"WI-SK-5012, WI-SK-5013",Prioritizing feature implementation over quality assurance due to tight deadlines.,"Implement a CI pipeline rule (WI-SK-6011) that measures code coverage and fails the build if it drops below a predefined threshold (e.g., 85%). Make passing this check a mandatory part of the pull request process.","If the library is released with low coverage, schedule a dedicated 'hardening sprint' to write missing tests and fix discovered bugs before it is widely integrated into the game client.",The code coverage report from the CI pipeline shows a value below the 85% threshold.,QA Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-003,Technical,"The developer may not fully grasp the principles of Domain-Driven Design, leading to incorrect implementations of Value Objects (e.g., making them mutable) or Entities, creating subtle and hard-to-debug issues.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-SK-2011, WI-SK-3013, WI-SK-3014, WI-SK-3015",Skills gap in a specialized architectural pattern (DDD).,"Conduct mandatory, rigorous code reviews for all core domain models by a senior developer with strong DDD experience. Create a 'DDD Best Practices' checklist for reviewers. Use pair programming for the initial implementation of the `ValueObject` base class.","If a flawed implementation is discovered late, create technical debt tickets and schedule a refactoring phase to correct the models before building significant logic on top of them.",Repeated comments in pull request reviews related to DDD principle violations (immutability, value equality, etc.).,Tech Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-004,Integration,"The POCOs designed for persistence (EPIC-SK-004) may have subtle issues when serialized/deserialized by the specific JSON library used in the Unity client (e.g., `Newtonsoft.Json` vs. `System.Text.Json` vs. Unity's `JsonUtility`), causing data loss or crashes.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-SK-4011, WI-SK-4012, WI-SK-4013",Incompatibilities or differing default behaviors between JSON serialization libraries.,"As part of the initial 'smoke test' (see RISK-SK-001), include a test case that serializes and deserializes a `PlayerProfile` object using the exact same JSON library and version planned for the main Unity project. Verify that all data is preserved.","If issues are found, add serialization-specific attributes (e.g., `[JsonProperty]`) to the models to force correct behavior, or write custom converters for problematic types. If necessary, switch the library in Unity to match a fully compatible one.",Unit test for serialization in the smoke test project fails, or deserialized objects have null or default values unexpectedly.,Tech Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-005,Timeline,"A delay in completing a foundational work item (e.g., `WI-SK-2011 ValueObject`) will have a cascading delay effect on all dependent tasks, potentially halting progress on entire epics.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-SK-3013, WI-SK-3014, WI-SK-3015, EPIC-SK-005",Tight coupling and sequential nature of foundational development tasks.,"Prioritize and timebox the implementation of tasks with the most dependents (the 'critical path'). Ensure the developer assigned to these tasks has no other blocking responsibilities. Front-load the work on `EPIC-SK-002` and foundational items in `EPIC-SK-003`.","If a foundational task is blocked, re-prioritize work on non-dependent tasks (e.g., from `EPIC-SK-004` or `EPIC-SK-006`) to maintain development momentum. Break down the blocking task into smaller, completable parts if possible.",A task on the critical path is not completed by its internal deadline.,Project Manager,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-006,Resource,"The entire `SharedKernel` library, being a foundational and specialized component, could become dependent on a single developer who holds all the knowledge, creating a bottleneck and a major risk if that person becomes unavailable.",3,4,12,Medium,Entire Project,Concentration of specialized knowledge (DDD, C# library design) in one individual.,"Enforce a policy of pair programming for critical components like `ValueObject` and `Grid`. Ensure all pull requests are reviewed by at least two other developers. Hold regular knowledge-sharing sessions where the lead developer explains design decisions to the wider team.","Maintain high-quality, up-to-date documentation (as per WI-SK-6012 and XML doc comments) that explains the 'why' behind the design, not just the 'what'. If the key person leaves, this documentation becomes the primary resource for the new developer.",Only one developer is consistently contributing to and reviewing code for this repository over a 2-week period.,Project Manager,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-007,Operational,"Improper versioning or distribution of the `SharedKernel` as a package can lead to dependency hell in consuming projects, where different parts of the application require conflicting versions of the library.",3,3,9,Medium,"DeploymentMethod, CI/CD",Lack of a clear versioning and package release strategy.,"Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0 for the NuGet package. Automate the packaging and release process through the CI/CD pipeline (WI-SK-6011). Document the release process and how consumers should handle updates.","If a breaking change is accidentally released as a minor/patch version, immediately yank the package from the feed and release a new major version with the same changes. Communicate clearly to all consuming teams about the mistake and the required upgrade path.",A consuming project reports a build failure due to a dependency conflict related to the SharedKernel package.,DevOps Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-SK-008,Quality,"The CI pipeline (WI-SK-6011) could become 'flaky', with tests failing intermittently for reasons unrelated to code changes (e.g., runner environment issues). This erodes team trust in the pipeline, leading them to ignore genuine failures.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-SK-6011, EPIC-SK-005",Poorly written tests that are not deterministic, or infrastructure instability in the CI environment.,"Write deterministic, isolated unit tests without external dependencies. Use retries for steps known to be occasionally flaky (e.g., package restore). Have a zero-tolerance policy for flaky tests: if a test is flaky, it should be fixed or disabled immediately.","If the main pipeline becomes unreliable, create a separate, simplified 'smoke test' pipeline that only runs the most critical build and test steps to provide a baseline signal of health while the main pipeline is being stabilized.",A CI build fails on the `main` branch and then passes on a re-run with no code changes.,DevOps Lead,TBD,Open
