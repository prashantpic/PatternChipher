RC-RISK-001,Operational,"A syntactically incorrect or schema-non-compliant JSON file is manually deployed to the production environment, causing client applications to fail parsing and potentially breaking core game functionality for all users.",3,5,15,High,"WI-RC-312, EPIC-RC-003","Human error during the manual promotion step from staging to production, bypassing the automated checks that exist for pull requests.",Implement a pre-deployment tool for the production environment that re-validates the JSON syntax and schema before publishing. Enforce a two-person approval rule in the Firebase console for production promotions.,Immediately execute the documented rollback plan (WI-RC-312) by re-publishing the last known-good version from the Firebase Remote Config version history.,A sudden spike in client-side analytics errors related to 'ConfigParsingFailure'. A flood of user complaints immediately following a production configuration update.,Lead Developer,2024-09-15,Open
RC-RISK-002,Technical,"A change is made to the `remote_config_template.json` schema (e.g., renaming a key, changing a data type) that is not backward compatible with older, deployed client versions, causing crashes or undefined behavior.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-RC-113, WI-RC-114, WI-RC-115, WI-RC-116","Lack of coordination between client development and live-ops teams. The `schemaVersion` is not properly managed or the client-side parsing logic is not robust enough to handle unexpected schema changes.",Enforce a strict policy for schema changes: breaking changes require a major `schemaVersion` bump and must be coordinated with a mandatory client update. The client must be implemented to handle parsing failures gracefully by falling back to hardcoded defaults.,If a breaking change is deployed prematurely, roll it back immediately. If not possible, deploy a new, compatible configuration that supports both old and new client versions by including both old and new fields.,Analytics reports showing a spike in parsing errors or crashes correlated with a specific, older client version after a remote config update.,Lead Developer,2024-09-01,Open
RC-RISK-003,Quality,"Game designers introduce changes to `scoringRules` or `difficultyTiers` that are not adequately tested, leading to a negative player experience (e.g., levels are too hard, progression stalls, economy is broken).",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-RC-114, WI-RC-115, WI-RC-116","Insufficient or rushed QA testing and analysis of the downstream impact of configuration changes on game balance and player satisfaction.",Mandate that all balancing changes are tested by QA in the staging environment against a predefined checklist of player experience metrics. Utilize Firebase A/B testing to roll out significant balancing changes to a small percentage of users first.,Immediately roll back the offending configuration change to the previous known-good state. Post a status update to the community if the issue was widespread and noticeable.,A significant drop in key performance indicators (KPIs) like level completion rate, daily active users, or session duration. A surge of negative feedback on app stores or social media about game difficulty.,QA Lead,2024-09-20,Open
RC-RISK-004,Resource,"Game designers who populate values in the JSON file lack sufficient proficiency with JSON syntax or the Git workflow, leading to frequent errors, development bottlenecks, and reliance on developers for simple value changes.",4,2,8,Medium,"WI-RC-113, WI-RC-114, WI-RC-115, WI-RC-116","Expecting non-technical or semi-technical staff to directly edit structured configuration files without providing appropriate tools or training.",Provide extensive training and clear documentation for the Git workflow and JSON syntax. Develop a simple web-based GUI or tool that allows designers to edit parameters, which then generates a correctly formatted PR.,Designate a 'configuration manager' developer as a temporary single point of contact responsible for translating designer requests into JSON changes and managing the PR process.,A high number of failed CI checks on PRs originating from the game design team. Developer feedback indicating significant time spent fixing syntax errors or merge conflicts in the config file.,Project Manager,2024-10-01,Open
RC-RISK-005,Operational,"The CI/CD pipeline for automated staging deployment (WI-RC-212) fails due to expired credentials, brittle scripts, or breaking changes in the Firebase CLI, blocking the ability to test new configurations.",3,3,9,Medium,WI-RC-212,"CI/CD processes are not monitored as production systems, and secrets (like service account keys) have a finite lifetime.",Implement automated monitoring and alerting for the CI/CD pipeline itself. Add a recurring calendar task and process for rotating CI/CD secrets before they expire. Ensure scripts use version-pinned CLI tools.,Temporarily revert to a documented manual deployment process for the staging environment while the automated pipeline is being fixed. This manual process must still require a PR and approval.,Automated alerts from the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) on pipeline failures. Developers report an inability to have their merged changes appear in the staging environment.,DevOps Lead,2024-09-30,Open
RC-RISK-006,External,"The third-party Firebase Remote Config service experiences a significant outage or high latency, preventing game clients from fetching the latest configuration and disabling live-ops capabilities.",2,4,8,Medium,"EPIC-RC-001, EPIC-RC-002, EPIC-RC-003","The project has a hard dependency on an external cloud service whose uptime is outside the project team's control.","Ensure the client application implements a robust 'stale-while-revalidate' caching strategy for the configuration. The client MUST contain a complete set of sensible, hardcoded default values to use if the service is unreachable on first launch.",Monitor the official Firebase status page and communicate the issue to players via social media or in-app messaging if the outage is prolonged. No direct technical action is possible until the service is restored.,The official Firebase status page reports an issue with Remote Config. A spike in client-side analytics showing config fetch timeouts or errors.,Lead Developer,2024-09-01,Open
RC-RISK-007,Technical,"Multiple team members create conflicting edits to the single `remote_config_template.json` file in parallel branches, resulting in a complex merge conflict that leads to an incorrectly merged file and unintended behavior in production.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-RC-113, WI-RC-114, WI-RC-115, WI-RC-116","A monolithic configuration file is a natural point of contention for concurrent work streams, making merges inherently risky.",Promote a workflow of frequent, small, targeted changes in short-lived branches. Use a pull request template that requires the author to describe their changes and potential conflicts. Encourage proactive communication in team chat about planned config changes.,Use `git revert` to immediately undo the faulty merge commit. The owner of the PR is then responsible for creating a new branch, carefully resolving the conflicts, and submitting a new PR with a thorough description of the resolution.,Post-deployment analysis or QA testing reveals that a recently-merged change is missing, or an old change has unexpectedly reappeared. PRs frequently have merge conflicts that require manual resolution.,Project Manager,2024-09-15,Open
RC-RISK-008,Operational,"The documentation for the manual production promotion and rollback process (WI-RC-312) is unclear, out-of-date, or incomplete, leading an authorized operator to make a mistake during a critical deployment or incident response.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-RC-312,"Documentation is not treated as a first-class artifact and is not maintained as the process or underlying tools (like the Firebase Console UI) evolve.",Treat the documentation as code: any change to the process requires a corresponding change to the documentation in the same PR. Periodically (e.g., quarterly) have a team member re-validate the documented steps in the staging environment.,Ensure at least two people are authorized and trained for the process. If one person is unsure, they must consult the second before proceeding. Have a direct communication channel open to the Lead Developer during any production deployment window.,A new team member is unable to follow the documentation without assistance. The Firebase console UI changes, making screenshots or steps in the documentation obsolete.,Lead Developer,2024-09-20,Open
