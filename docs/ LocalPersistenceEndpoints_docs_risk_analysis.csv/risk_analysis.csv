RISK-PERSIST-001,Technical,"A bug in the custom XOR obfuscation or SHA256 checksum logic in `SimpleXorDataProtector` could lead to either easily hackable save files, or worse, valid save files being flagged as corrupt, causing data loss.",4,4,16,High,"WI-PERSIST-007, WI-PERSIST-008, WI-PERSIST-012, WI-PERSIST-013","The inherent difficulty of correctly implementing even simple cryptographic and integrity-checking schemes.","Mandate peer review of the `SimpleXorDataProtector` logic. Implement an extensive unit test suite covering round-trip success, known-tamper failures, and edge cases (empty data, special characters).","If the protector is found to be unreliable in production, a hotfix will be deployed that can bypass the check for specific versions to allow data recovery. A more robust, platform-native protection mechanism will be implemented in the next major release.",A spike in `SaveDataCorruptionException` logs following a release. Unit tests for the protector failing.,Tech Lead,2024-09-15,Open
RISK-PERSIST-002,Quality,"A bug in a `IMigrationScript` or a missing script in the sequence within `MigrationService` could cause an unrecoverable failure when a user updates the app, leading to permanent loss of their progress.",3,5,15,High,"WI-PERSIST-007, WI-PERSIST-009, WI-PERSIST-010, WI-PERSIST-013","The complexity of managing an ordered, stateful data transformation chain. Human error in creating or registering a migration script.","The persistence service will automatically create a backup of the save file before attempting migration. A comprehensive test suite will be created to test the entire migration path from V1 to the latest version using sample data for each schema.",If migration fails, the service will log the detailed error, restore the backup, and allow the game to proceed with the un-migrated data (potentially with limited functionality). A hotfix with the corrected migration script will be prioritized.,A failed migration is logged from a client device. Unit tests for the migration chain fail.,Tech Lead,2024-09-20,Open
RISK-PERSIST-003,Operational,"The manual deployment method of copying DLLs into the Unity project is error-prone. An incorrect (e.g., Debug instead of Release) or outdated DLL could be deployed, causing performance issues or runtime crashes.",5,3,15,High,"WI-PERSIST-001, and all integration points in the Unity project","Reliance on a manual process for a critical deployment step.","Create an automated build script (`.sh` or `.ps1`) that builds the C# project in Release configuration and copies the required DLLs (`PatternCipher.Infrastructure.Persistence.dll`, `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`) to the correct directory in the Unity project.","Maintain a strict, version-controlled checklist for the manual deployment process. The first-line response to a related bug is to re-execute the entire deployment process from scratch following the checklist.",Runtime errors like `MethodNotFoundException` or `TypeLoadException` in Unity logs. Unexpected performance degradation after an update.,DevOps Lead,2024-09-10,Open
RISK-PERSIST-004,Performance,"The implementation of `LocalFileRepository`'s async methods may incorrectly perform I/O operations on the Unity main thread (by not using `Task.Run` correctly), causing the game to stutter or freeze during save operations.",3,5,15,High,"WI-PERSIST-005, WI-PERSIST-007, WI-PERSIST-011","Lack of developer familiarity with Unity's single-threaded architecture and the proper way to offload work.","Enforce strict code reviews for all I/O code. Implement specific performance tests within Unity, using the Profiler to confirm that file I/O operations do not execute on the main thread and that frame rate is not impacted.",If stutters are detected, the responsible code will be immediately refactored. If a synchronous operation (like `SaveInProgressState`) is the cause, it will be converted to an asynchronous 'fire-and-forget' call.,Unity Profiler shows spikes in `System.IO` calls on the main thread. User reports of stuttering during gameplay moments where auto-saving occurs.,Tech Lead,2024-09-15,Open
RISK-PERSIST-005,Technical,"Subtle API or behavior differences between the .NET Standard 2.1 version used for library development and the Mono/.NET runtime version used by the target Unity Editor could cause unexpected runtime errors not caught by unit tests.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-PERSIST-001, WI-PERSIST-005","Divergence in .NET implementations across different platforms and runtimes.","Establish a CI pipeline that, upon every commit to the persistence library, automatically copies the resulting DLL into a dedicated test Unity project and runs a set of basic integration tests (e.g., save and load a simple object).","Allocate buffer time in the schedule for diagnosing and implementing workarounds for Unity-specific compatibility issues. If a feature is fundamentally incompatible, it will be reimplemented using Unity-native APIs.",Integration tests in the test Unity project fail. A new Unity version is released, requiring a re-validation pass.,QA Lead,2024-09-30,Open
RISK-PERSIST-006,Quality,"Unit test coverage for complex components like `PersistenceService` and `MigrationService` may be incomplete, giving a false sense of security and allowing critical edge-case bugs to reach production.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-PERSIST-012, WI-PERSIST-013","The difficulty of anticipating all possible failure modes and data states in a complex orchestration. Rushing to meet deadlines can lead to cutting corners on test thoroughness.","Enforce a minimum code coverage metric (e.g., 85% branch coverage) in the CI pipeline. Code reviews must include a specific check on the quality and completeness of tests for the new logic.","When a production bug is discovered, the standard procedure will be to first write a failing unit test that reproduces the bug, then write the fix, ensuring the bug cannot regress.","Code coverage reports drop below the defined threshold. A production bug is found in a component that had high reported test coverage, indicating the tests were not effective.,QA Lead,2024-10-01,Open
RISK-PERSIST-007,Resource,"The high complexity of the security and migration systems may lead to only one developer having a deep understanding, creating a key-person dependency and a bottleneck.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-PERSIST-008, WI-PERSIST-009, WI-PERSIST-013","Organic assignment of complex tasks to the most senior/experienced developer without a formal knowledge transfer plan.","Mandate pair programming sessions for the implementation of `SimpleXorDataProtector` and `MigrationService`. Ensure technical documentation in the code is exceptionally clear and detailed.","If the key developer is unavailable, the second developer from the pair programming session will take over. The detailed documentation and extensive unit tests will serve as the primary source of truth for ramp-up. Accept a temporary slowdown in progress.",A review of task assignments shows one developer is the sole owner of all 'High' complexity tasks in this repository.,Project Manager,2024-09-01,Open
RISK-PERSIST-008,External,"A newly discovered security vulnerability or a critical bug in the pinned version of `Newtonsoft.Json` could force an emergency upgrade, which may introduce breaking changes.",2,3,6,Low,"WI-PERSIST-001, WI-PERSIST-004","Dependency on a third-party library introduces risks outside the team's direct control.","The `IJsonSerializer` interface abstracts the library, making it replaceable. The library version is pinned in the `.csproj` file to prevent unexpected updates. Regularly review security bulletins for dependencies.","If a critical vulnerability is found, prioritize the task of upgrading the library and fixing any breaking changes. If the upgrade is too complex, implement the `IJsonSerializer` interface with a different library like `System.Text.Json` (if compatible).",A high-severity vulnerability is announced for the version of `Newtonsoft.Json` being used.,Tech Lead,2024-10-15,Open
