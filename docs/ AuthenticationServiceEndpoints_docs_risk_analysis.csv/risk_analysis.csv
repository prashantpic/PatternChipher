RISK-AUTH-001,External,"The setup.guide.md becomes inaccurate due to unmonitored UI or process changes in the Google Cloud or Apple Developer portals, causing developer confusion, implementation errors, and project delays.",4,4,16,High,"WI-AUTH-004, WI-AUTH-005, WI-AUTH-006",Dependency on volatile third-party UIs outside of project control.,"Institute a mandatory quarterly review of the entire setup guide. Subscribe key personnel to developer newsletters from Apple and Google. The initial dry-run (WI-AUTH-006) must be performed by someone other than the author.",Allocate a 'fast-track' resource budget to immediately investigate and update the documentation if an issue is reported. Maintain a backlog item for this potential work.,"A client developer reports a discrepancy between the guide and the live console. An announcement of a console redesign from Apple/Google is published.",Engineering Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-002,Operational,"An administrator manually applying the settings from authentication.config.json to the live Firebase console makes a mistake, potentially disabling a sign-in method or causing a service outage for users.",3,5,15,High,"EPIC-AUTH-001, EPIC-AUTH-002",Reliance on a manual, error-prone deployment process for critical infrastructure configuration.,"Create a detailed deployment checklist. Require a two-person peer review process for applying changes, where one person executes and the other verifies against the checklist. Use a staging/dev Firebase project to validate changes first.",Maintain versioned screenshots of known-good configurations. Document a clear rollback procedure for each setting that can be changed.,"Post-deployment monitoring shows a spike in authentication failures. A new configuration is scheduled for deployment.",DevOps Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-003,Quality,"The client application team (REPO-PATT-001) misinterprets the compliance.policy.md and fails to correctly implement the client-side age gate or conditional UI, leading to a legal and brand-damaging violation of COPPA/GDPR-K.",3,5,15,High,"WI-AUTH-007, WI-AUTH-008",Lack of a shared understanding and formal handover process between the policy authors and the policy implementers.,"Hold a mandatory joint review session of the `compliance.policy.md` with the client development team leads. Create specific, detailed test cases for the client QA team to verify the age gate and conditional UI logic. The policy document must include explicit examples.",Prioritize an immediate client-side hotfix to disable the non-compliant features. Prepare a data breach response plan in consultation with legal.,"QA testing fails a compliance-related test case. An internal audit discovers the incorrect UI flow. A user complaint is received.",Product Owner,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-004,Quality,"The dry-run validation of the setup guide (WI-AUTH-006) is incomplete or misses platform-specific edge cases, resulting in a guide that is still flawed and causes issues for downstream developers.",3,3,9,Medium,WI-AUTH-006,"The validator lacks experience with one of the platforms (e.g., strong on GCP, weak on Apple) or only performs a 'happy path' test.",If possible, have two separate validators perform the dry-run: one for the Google flow and one for the Apple flow. Provide the validator with a checklist of edge cases to test (e.g., cancelling auth flow, using an account with 2FA).,Treat feedback from the first client development team using the guide as a high-priority bug-fix cycle for the documentation itself. Be prepared to provide direct support.,The validator reports they only have experience with one of the two platforms. The first team using the guide reports an error.,Engineering Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-005,Timeline,"The legal or product stakeholders required for the compliance policy review (WI-AUTH-008) are unavailable or unresponsive, delaying the finalization of a critical policy and blocking related client-side development.",3,3,9,Medium,WI-AUTH-008,Dependency on external team members with different priorities and schedules.,"Schedule the review meeting far in advance. Send the draft policy to stakeholders a week before the meeting with a clear deadline for pre-reading and feedback. Identify and brief a delegate for each key stakeholder.",Proceed with client-side development based on the draft policy, but ensure the feature is disabled by default via a feature flag until final sign-off is received. Document the risk of rework.,A review meeting is postponed more than once. No feedback is received from a key stakeholder by the requested deadline.,Product Owner,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-006,External,"Firebase updates its Authentication service in a way that changes the meaning or structure of the settings defined in authentication.config.json, making the local configuration-as-code file obsolete or incorrect.",2,4,8,Medium,"WI-AUTH-001, WI-AUTH-002, WI-AUTH-003",Dependency on a third-party managed service (PaaS) API/schema.,The developer responsible for applying the configuration should, as part of a deployment checklist, verify that the options in the Firebase Console UI still match the structure of the JSON file. Subscribe to Firebase release notes.,If a breaking change is discovered, create a high-priority task to update the JSON schema, SDS, and any dependent logic. Block deployment of the outdated configuration.,A developer notices a new or changed setting in the Firebase Authentication console during deployment. Firebase publishes release notes indicating a change.,Engineering Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-007,Resource,"The developer assigned to author and validate the setup guides (WI-AUTH-004, WI-AUTH-005, WI-AUTH-006) lacks the necessary access to a valid Apple Developer Program account, delaying documentation and validation.",2,3,6,Low,"WI-AUTH-004, WI-AUTH-005, WI-AUTH-006",Bureaucracy or cost associated with provisioning required third-party developer accounts.,Confirm developer account access for all required platforms as part of project kickoff, before tasks are assigned. Procure accounts immediately if gaps exist.,Use screenshots and documentation from official Apple sources as a temporary measure while account access is being sorted. This will likely result in a lower-quality guide and must be noted as a known issue.,The assigned developer reports they do not have an active Apple Developer account at the start of the work stream.,Project Manager,TBD,Open
RISK-AUTH-008,Operational,"The linting process configured in WI-AUTH-010 is too permissive or is bypassed, allowing poorly formatted or syntactically incorrect configuration or documentation to be merged.",2,2,4,Low,WI-AUTH-010,Poorly configured CI/CD quality gates or developers having permission to override PR checks.,"Enforce branch protection rules that require the linting CI job to pass before a pull request can be merged. Use established, strict linting rule sets (e.g., Prettier) rather than custom, permissive ones.",A senior developer must manually review and fix the formatting/syntax on the main branch. A post-mortem is held to strengthen the CI process.,A developer merges a pull request despite a failing CI check. A downstream process fails due to malformed JSON.,DevOps Lead,TBD,Open
