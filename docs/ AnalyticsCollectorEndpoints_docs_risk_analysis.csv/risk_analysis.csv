RISK-AC-001,Operational,"The live Firebase Analytics configuration in the console becomes desynchronized from the `analytics_configuration.yaml` file due to manual, out-of-band changes.",4,4,16,High,"WI-ANA-001, EPIC-ANA-001","The deployment process for service configuration is manual and procedural, making it prone to human error or un-tracked ""hot-fixes"".",Implement a scheduled, automated audit script that compares live Firebase Console settings against `analytics_configuration.yaml` and reports differences. Document a strict policy that all changes must go through a repository Pull Request.,If drift is detected, create an emergency PR to align the repository with the desired state (either by reverting the manual change or updating the repo). Perform a root cause analysis of why the manual change was made outside the process.,A scheduled audit script reports a diff. A new feature behaves unexpectedly in analytics, or data in BigQuery is missing expected fields.,Data Lead,2024-08-30,Not Started
RISK-AC-002,Quality,"The `privacy_compliance_map.json` is not updated when new events/parameters are added, leading to data being collected with incorrect or missing privacy rules.",3,5,15,High,"WI-ANA-004, WI-ANA-006","Human error in a multi-file update process. A developer might add a new event parameter but forget to add its corresponding entry in the privacy map.",The primary mitigation is the cross-schema consistency check script (WI-ANA-006). Augment this with a mandatory checklist in the Pull Request template that requires developers to explicitly confirm they have updated all relevant files.,If an inconsistency is deployed, immediately hotfix the `privacy_compliance_map.json`. Trigger a data analysis query to identify any data collected under the wrong policy and evaluate if data deletion is necessary. Perform a post-mortem on the validation script failure.,The CI build fails on the consistency check step. A post-deployment audit finds a parameter is missing from the compliance map.,Tech Lead,2024-08-15,Not Started
RISK-AC-003,Technical,"The custom cross-schema consistency check script (`WI-ANA-006`) is complex and may contain bugs, giving a false sense of security and allowing inconsistent schemas to be merged.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-ANA-006,"The validation logic is custom-built and not a standard linter. Its own correctness is not guaranteed without dedicated testing.",Require unit tests for the validation script itself. The script must be peer-reviewed by at least two engineers. Use a well-known language like Python with standard libraries for JSON parsing to reduce risk.,If the script is found to be flawed, disable the merge check temporarily, fix the script on a separate branch with its own tests, and re-run the fixed script against the main branch to find any inconsistencies it previously missed.,An inconsistency is found manually in production after a PR successfully passed the CI check.,DevOps Engineer,2024-08-20,Not Started
RISK-AC-004,Quality,"Descriptions in the schema files (`custom_events.json`, `user_properties.json`) are unclear, leading to incorrect implementation by the client team and misinterpretation by the data analysis team.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-ANA-002, WI-ANA-003, WI-ANA-007","Lack of a formal, multi-disciplinary review process for schema definitions, allowing ambiguity to persist.",Establish a formal review and sign-off process for all schema changes (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) that requires approval from both a client development lead and a data analysis lead. Use concrete examples in descriptions where possible.,If data is found to be incorrectly implemented, create a new version of the event/property (e.g., `level_complete_v2`). Update the client implementation and deprecate the old event to avoid corrupting historical data.,Data analyst reports that received data for a parameter doesn't match its description (e.g., 'time_taken_seconds' is sent in milliseconds).,Product Manager,2024-08-10,Not Started
RISK-AC-005,External,"Firebase Analytics or BigQuery deprecates a feature or changes its configuration schema, making the settings in `analytics_configuration.yaml` obsolete or incorrect.",2,4,8,Medium,WI-ANA-001,"Dependency on third-party PaaS services whose roadmaps are outside of project control.",Assign a team member to subscribe to official Firebase and Google Cloud Platform update channels. Periodically (e.g., quarterly) review the `analytics_configuration.yaml` against the current Firebase documentation.,Upon notification of a breaking change, create a high-priority task to analyze the impact and update the configuration file. Communicate the change and timeline to all dependent teams.,Receiving a deprecation notice from Google. A configuration setting stops working or the BigQuery export fails.,Data Lead,2024-09-15,Not Started
RISK-AC-006,Resource,"The knowledge of data privacy rules and their implementation in `privacy_compliance_map.json` is held by a single person, creating a bottleneck and risk.",3,3,9,Medium,WI-ANA-004,"Specialized compliance knowledge is not widely distributed across the team.",Ensure that all Pull Requests related to the compliance map are reviewed by at least two people. Document the rationale behind compliance choices in a `PRIVACY.md` file. Hold a brown-bag session to explain the compliance framework to the wider team.,If the key person is unavailable, escalate PR reviews to a legal/compliance advisor. If not available, halt all schema changes that require new privacy decisions until the key person returns or a replacement is trained.,Review of PR approval history shows that only one person is ever approving compliance-related changes.,Engineering Manager,2024-08-25,Not Started
RISK-AC-007,Operational,"A change is merged to the repository, but downstream teams (client developers, data analysts) are not notified or do not act on it, causing the implementation to diverge from the contract.",4,3,12,Medium,"EPIC-ANA-001, EPIC-ANA-002","The deployment process is procedural and relies on manual human communication to trigger work in other teams.",Automate notifications upon merge to the main branch. A CI action can post a message to a shared Slack/Teams channel, detailing the files changed. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` must explicitly state the communication responsibilities of the merging developer.,Establish a versioning system for the schemas. The client should report which schema version it's built against, allowing the data team to correctly interpret incoming data, even if it's from an older client version.,A developer merges a change to any file in the `schemas/` directory.,Tech Lead,2024-08-15,Not Started
RISK-AC-008,Timeline,"The complexity of creating a robust, bug-free consistency checker script (`WI-ANA-006`) is underestimated, delaying the implementation of the full CI pipeline.",3,2,6,Low,WI-ANA-006,"The task is labeled ""High"" complexity, which often carries estimation risk. The scripting requires logic, file I/O, and integration with the CI system.",Prioritize the script development early. Develop the script iteratively, starting with simple checks (e.g., ensuring all files are valid JSON) before adding complex cross-file validation logic.,If the script proves too complex for the timeline, launch with a simplified version (e.g., only checks that keys in the privacy map are not empty) and a manual PR checklist as a temporary measure, and create a backlog item to enhance it.,The work item `WI-ANA-006` is not completed by its internal deadline, blocking the finalization of the CI pipeline.,DevOps Engineer,2024-08-20,Not Started
