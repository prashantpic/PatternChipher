TASK-PERSIST-001,"Setup C# Project, Folders, and Dependencies",DevOps,Backend Development,Low,3.2,Junior,1,"",True,"Straightforward configuration task. Involves setting up the .csproj to target .NET Standard 2.1 and adding NuGet packages. Crucial first step.","Use a project template/scaffolding tool (e.g., `dotnet new`) to automate the initial setup."
TASK-PERSIST-002,"Define All Core Service Interfaces",Backend Development,Design,Medium,5.2,Mid,1,TASK-PERSIST-001,True,"Crucial architectural task. Requires careful attention to detail to match the Software Design Specification (SDS) exactly. Defines the contracts for the entire system.","Could be combined with implementation tasks in a TDD approach, where interfaces evolve as tests are written for the services."
TASK-PERSIST-003,"Implement Data Models and Custom Exception",Backend Development,,Low,3,Junior,1,TASK-PERSIST-001,True,"Fundamental task creating the core data transfer object and a specific exception for handling data integrity failures.","For more complex DTOs, code generation tools could be used based on a schema definition."

TASK-PERSIST-005,"Implement `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer`",Backend Development,,Low,3.2,Mid,1,TASK-PERSIST-002,False,"A simple but important wrapper. The developer should ensure it correctly handles generic types and propagates exceptions.","Use System.Text.Json for potentially better performance and fewer external dependencies, but requires verification of compatibility with the target Unity version."
TASK-PERSIST-006,"Unit Test `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer`",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,4.2,Mid,1,"TASK-PERSIST-004,TASK-PERSIST-005",False,"Verifies the core serialization functionality.

Resource must be proficient with async/await and `Task.Run()` to correctly offload I/O from the main thread.","Use a platform-specific async file I/O API if available and more performant, at the cost of platform-agnostic code."
TASK-PERSIST-008,"Unit Test `LocalFileRepository`",Quality Assurance,DevOps,Medium,7.5,Mid,1,"TASK-PERSIST-004,TASK-PERSIST-007",False,"This is a light integration test, not a pure unit test. Requires proper test setup/teardown logic to manage temporary files and directories to avoid side effects.","Use a mock file system library (e.g., `System.IO.Abstractions.TestingHelpers`) to create faster, more reliable unit tests that don't touch the actual disk."
TASK-PERSIST-009,"Implement `SimpleXorDataProtector.Protect` method",Backend Development,Data Engineering,High,8.2,Senior,2,"TASK-PERSIST-002,TASK-PERSIST-003",True,"High-risk security task. Requires a Senior developer with a solid understanding of hashing (SHA256) and byte-level manipulation.

TASK-PERSIST-010,"Implement `SimpleXorDataProtector.Unprotect` method",Backend Development,Data Engineering,High,8.2,Senior,2,"TASK-PERSIST-003,TASK-PERSIST-009",True,"Counterpart to the Protect method. Logic must be an exact inverse. Error handling is critical, especially throwing the custom `SaveDataCorruptionException` on any integrity failure. Pair programming recommended.","Instead of throwing an exception on failure, the method could return a result object (e.g., `Result<string>`) to provide more structured error information to the caller."
TASK-PERSIST-011,"Unit Test `SimpleXorDataProtector` Roundtrip",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"TASK-PERSIST-004,TASK-PERSIST-010",False,"Happy-path testing to ensure the basic functionality works. Should test with empty strings, simple JSON, and complex nested JSON.",""

TASK-PERSIST-013,"Implement `MigrationService`",Backend Development,Data Engineering,High,10.3,Senior,2,"TASK-PERSIST-002,TASK-PERSIST-014",True,"Complex orchestration logic. Requires a Senior developer comfortable with LINQ, dynamic JSON manipulation (JObject), and the Strategy Pattern. Pair programming recommended per RISK-PERSIST-007.","Instead of manual JObject manipulation, use JSON Patch (RFC 6902) to define migrations declaratively, which can be less error-prone."
TASK-PERSIST-014,"Implement Example `MigrationScript_V1_to_V2`",Backend Development,,Medium,5,Mid,1,TASK-PERSIST-002,True,"Serves as the template and proof-of-concept for all future migration scripts. The resource should focus on creating a clean, readable, and defensive implementation.",""
