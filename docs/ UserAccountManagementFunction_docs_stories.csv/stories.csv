"US-001","Project Scaffolding and Configuration","Developer sets up the project foundation","Developer","As a Developer, I want a fully configured project foundation with all dependencies, scripts, and a clear directory structure so that I can start developing features efficiently and consistently.","Must Have",3,"","Given the project is cloned, When I run `npm install`, then all dependencies from `package.json` are installed without errors.","Given the project is set up, When I run `npm run build`, then the TypeScript code from `src/` is successfully compiled into JavaScript in the `lib/` directory.","Given the project is set up, When I check the project structure, then the directories `src`, `test`, and their subdirectories as per the SDS are present and a `.gitignore` file excludes `node_modules` and `lib`.","WI-001, WI-002, WI-003","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-002","Project Scaffolding and Configuration","Developer creates core service utilities","Developer","As a Developer, I want a singleton Firebase Admin client and a structured logger utility so that I can interact with Firebase services efficiently and maintain consistent, debuggable logs across the application.","Must Have",2,"US-001","Given the Firebase Admin client is implemented, When other modules import it, then they receive a single, initialized instance of the Firebase Admin SDK.","Given the logger utility is implemented, When I call the `error` function with an Error object, then the full error stack trace is visible in the Firebase logs.","Given the logger utility is implemented, When I call `info` or `warn` with metadata, then the structured metadata is included in the log entry.","WI-004, WI-005","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-003","Project Scaffolding and Configuration","Developer defines the data contract for deletion requests","Developer","As a Developer, I want a strongly-typed Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the user deletion request so that I can ensure type safety and a clear data contract between the client and the function.","Must Have",1,"US-001","Given the DTO file is created, When I inspect the `UserDeletionRequest` interface, then it must contain a readonly property `uid` of type `string`.","Given the DTO is defined, When I use it in the handler function, then TypeScript provides type checking and autocompletion for the request payload.","","WI-006","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-004","Core Deletion Logic Implementation","System erases user data from all application databases","End User","As an End User requesting deletion, I want all my data permanently removed from the application's databases (Cloud Firestore) so that my personal information is no longer stored by the service.","Must Have",3,"US-002","Given a user with UID `test-uid` has a profile in the `UserProfiles` collection, When the deletion process is triggered for that UID, then the `UserProfiles/test-uid` document is deleted.","Given a user with UID `test-uid` has entries in the `LeaderboardEntries` collection, When the deletion process is triggered for that UID, then all leaderboard documents where `userId` is `test-uid` are deleted.","Given the deletion is triggered, When all related documents are being deleted, then the operation is performed as a single atomic batch write to ensure all-or-nothing deletion.","WI-007","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-005","Core Deletion Logic Implementation","System deletes user's authentication account","End User","As an End User requesting deletion, I want my authentication account permanently removed from the system so that I can no longer log in and my credentials are erased.","Must Have",1,"US-002","Given a user with UID `test-uid` exists in Firebase Authentication, When the deletion process is triggered for that UID, then the user's auth record is permanently deleted.","Given a user with UID `test-uid` has already been deleted from Firebase Authentication, When the deletion process is triggered again, then the function handles the `auth/user-not-found` error gracefully by logging a warning without failing the entire process.","","WI-008","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-006","Core Deletion Logic Implementation","System orchestrates a complete and safe data deletion","Compliance Officer","As a Compliance Officer, I want the user data deletion process to be orchestrated in a specific order (data first, then auth record) so that we prevent orphaned data and ensure a complete and auditable erasure.","Must Have",2,"US-004, US-005","Given a user deletion is requested for a valid UID, When the deletion service runs, then it first attempts to delete all Firestore documents associated with the user.","Given the Firestore documents have been successfully deleted, When the deletion service continues, then it proceeds to delete the user's Firebase Authentication record.","Given the service is called with a null or empty UID, When it executes, then it must throw an internal error and not proceed with any deletion calls.","WI-009","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-007","Function Handler and API Implementation","User requests their own account deletion","End User","As an End User, I want a secure endpoint that I can call to request the deletion of my own account and data so that I can exercise my right to be forgotten.","Must Have",3,"US-003, US-006","Given I am not logged in, When I attempt to call the `deleteUser` function, then the request fails with an `unauthenticated` error.","Given I am logged in as User A, When I attempt to call the `deleteUser` function with the UID of User B, then the request fails with a `permission-denied` error.","Given I am logged in as User A, When I call the `deleteUser` function with my own UID, then the account deletion service is triggered and I receive a success message.","WI-010, WI-011","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-008","Quality Assurance and Testing","Developer writes unit tests for the deletion logic","Developer","As a Developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the service and handler layers so that I can verify the business logic, security rules, and error handling in isolation and prevent regressions.","Must Have",5,"US-006, US-007","Given the unit tests for the Account Deletion Service, When the tests are run, then they verify that the Firestore adapter is called before the Auth adapter.","Given the unit tests for the User Deletion Handler, When the tests are run, then they verify that `unauthenticated` and `permission-denied` errors are correctly thrown based on the mocked call context.","Given the full unit test suite, When I run `npm run test`, then all tests pass and are reported in the CI/CD pipeline.","WI-012, WI-013","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
"US-009","Quality Assurance and Testing","Developer verifies the end-to-end deletion flow","Developer","As a Developer, I want an automated integration test that uses the Firebase Emulator Suite so that I can verify the entire account deletion process works correctly from the function trigger to the data being removed from all emulated backend services.","Must Have",8,"US-007","Given the Firebase emulators are running, When I run the integration test script, then a test user and their associated data are created in the emulated Auth and Firestore services.","Given the test user exists in the emulators, When the integration test invokes the `deleteUser` cloud function, then the function executes without internal errors and returns a success response.","Given the function has executed, When the test script queries the emulators, then it must confirm that the user's Auth record and all their Firestore documents have been deleted.","WI-014, WI-015","Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, passes all related automated checks, and is merged into the main branch."
