TASK-LBS-001,"Create and configure package.json with dependencies and scripts",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,1.1,Junior,1,"US-LBS-001",TRUE,"Fundamental setup task. Requires basic knowledge of Node.js ecosystem (npm/yarn).","Use a pre-configured project starter template for Firebase Functions with TypeScript to accelerate setup."
TASK-LBS-002,"Implement centralized configuration constants module",Backend Development,,Low,1.4,Junior,1,"US-LBS-001,TASK-LBS-001",TRUE,"A core task for maintainability. Ensures business rules are not hard-coded throughout the application.","For more dynamic configuration, especially for values that might change post-deployment, consider using Firebase Remote Config or environment variables."
TASK-LBS-003,"Implement and configure Firestore security rules",Backend Development,DevOps,Medium,4.5,Senior,1,"US-LBS-002",TRUE,"Critical security task. Requires a strong understanding of the Firebase Security Rules language and potential attack vectors. High impact if done incorrectly.","Implement security checks entirely within the Cloud Function logic and make rules more permissive. This is generally not recommended as it bypasses a key defense-in-depth layer."
TASK-LBS-004,"Define Firestore composite indexes for leaderboard queries",Backend Development,DevOps,Medium,2.2,Mid,1,"US-LBS-003",TRUE,"Essential for query performance. Incorrect indexes will lead to failed or slow queries. Requires understanding of Firestore indexing.","Instead of pre-defining, allow queries to fail in the emulator environment and use the Firebase CLI's error message link to auto-generate the required indexes."
TASK-LBS-007,"Define LeaderboardEntry domain model interface",Backend Development,,Low,1,Junior,1,"US-LBS-004,TASK-LBS-001",TRUE,"Defines the core data structure. A straightforward TypeScript task.","Use a class instead of an interface to allow for methods on the model object, though this is often not needed for simple data models."
TASK-LBS-008,"Define SubmitScore DTO and Joi validation schema",Backend Development,,Medium,2.7,Mid,1,"US-LBS-004,TASK-LBS-001",TRUE,"Creates the API contract. Experience with a validation library like Joi is beneficial.","Use `class-validator` with TypeScript decorators on a DTO class. This can provide a tighter integration with the code if classes are used for DTOs."
TASK-LBS-009,"Implement ScoreValidator domain service",Backend Development,,Medium,2.7,Mid,1,"US-LBS-005,TASK-LBS-002,TASK-LBS-008",TRUE,"Encapsulates core business logic. Straightforward implementation but requires careful attention to the rules defined in constants.","Place the validation logic directly inside the Application Service. This is less architecturally pure and makes the logic harder to test in isolation."
TASK-LBS-017,"Develop Unit Tests for ScoreValidatorService",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,4.6,Mid,1,"US-LBS-005,TASK-LBS-009",FALSE,"Requires experience with a testing framework like Jest. Critical for ensuring business logic correctness.","Rely solely on integration tests to cover this logic. This is riskier as it's harder to test all boundary conditions and makes feedback loops slower."
TASK-LBS-005,"Implement Firebase Admin SDK initializer module",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,1.1,Mid,1,"US-LBS-006,TASK-LBS-001",TRUE,"Ensures the Admin SDK is initialized only once (singleton pattern). A best practice for Firebase Functions.","Initialize the SDK directly in `src/index.ts`. This is less clean if multiple function files were to be used and complicates testing."
TASK-LBS-006,"Implement Leaderboard Repository for Firestore writes",Backend Development,,Medium,3.2,Mid,1,"US-LBS-006,""TASK-LBS-002,TASK-LBS-005,TASK-LBS-007""",TRUE,"Implements the Repository Pattern to abstract data access. Requires knowledge of the Firebase Admin SDK for Firestore.","Call Firestore methods directly from the Application Service (`LeaderboardService`), which would increase coupling between application logic and data persistence."
TASK-LBS-010,"Implement Leaderboard application service",Backend Development,,Medium,4.2,Mid,1,"US-LBS-007,TASK-LBS-009,TASK-LBS-006",TRUE,"Orchestrates the use case. Requires understanding of dependency injection and layering responsibilities in an application.","Combine all orchestration, validation, and persistence logic into the main `index.ts` function handler. This leads to a monolithic, hard-to-test function."
TASK-LBS-011,"Develop Unit Tests for LeaderboardService",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,High,5.8,Mid,1,"US-LBS-007,TASK-LBS-010",FALSE,"Complex unit testing task requiring mocking/stubbing of repository and validator dependencies.","Skip unit tests and rely only on integration tests. This makes it harder to test specific orchestration logic paths in isolation."
TASK-LBS-012,"Implement `submitScore` function structure and initial checks",Backend Development,DevOps,Medium,4,Mid,1,"US-LBS-008,""TASK-LBS-008,TASK-LBS-010""",TRUE,"Implements the function entrypoint, including critical authentication and DTO validation guards.","Perform all validation within the application service. This moves the initial request validation further down the stack, which is less efficient."
TASK-LBS-014,"Implement transactional rate-limiting logic",Backend Development,DevOps,High,8.5,Senior,1,"US-LBS-009,""TASK-LBS-002,TASK-LBS-005""",TRUE,"A complex, high-risk task. Requires deep understanding of Firestore transactions to prevent race conditions.","Use a simpler, non-transactional rate-limiting approach (e.g., just reading and writing). This is highly susceptible to race conditions and not recommended."
TASK-LBS-013,"Integrate services and error handling into `submitScore` function",Backend Development,,High,5.2,Mid,1,"US-LBS-008,""TASK-LBS-012,TASK-LBS-014""",TRUE,"Connects all the layers and implements top-level error handling. This is the final step in wiring the application logic.","Have the application service return success/error objects instead of throwing specific `HttpsError`s. This would require more boilerplate in the function handler."
TASK-LBS-018,"Setup Jest for integration testing with Firebase Emulators",DevOps,Quality Assurance,High,6.5,Senior,1,"US-LBS-011,TASK-LBS-001",TRUE,"Complex DevOps task to automate emulator startup/teardown for testing. Can be brittle.","Require developers to run emulators manually in a separate terminal before running the integration test suite. This is less automated and more error-prone."

Requires experience with CI syntax (e.g., GitHub Actions YAML).","Use local pre-commit hooks to run linting and tests. This doesn't enforce quality on the central repository."
TASK-LBS-023,"Add integration test step to CI workflow",DevOps,Quality Assurance,Very High,9.5,Senior,1,"US-LBS-012,""TASK-LBS-022,TASK-LBS-018""",TRUE,"Highly complex task. Setting up Java and Firebase Emulators in a CI runner can be flaky and time-consuming to debug.","Run integration tests as a separate, nightly build job instead of on every PR. This provides slower feedback but can be more stable."
TASK-LBS-024,"Setup CD workflow for deployment to staging",DevOps,Backend Development,High,8.5,Senior,1,"US-LBS-012,TASK-LBS-023",TRUE,"Critical for automated delivery. Requires secure management of Firebase service account credentials/tokens in the CI environment.","Manual deployment from a developer's machine using the Firebase CLI. This is not repeatable, is prone to human error, and has security risks."
