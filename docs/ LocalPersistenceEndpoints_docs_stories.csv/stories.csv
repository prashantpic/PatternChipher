US-001,"Core Persistence Framework & Interfaces",Establish the persistence library's foundational structure,Developer,"As a Developer, I want a well-defined project structure with all necessary interfaces and data models so that I have a clear and stable foundation for implementing the persistence logic.",Must Have,5,"","Given the project is opened in an IDE, When the solution is built, Then it compiles successfully without any missing files or incorrect configurations.","Given the project source code, When I inspect the `Interfaces` folder, Then all contracts (`IPersistenceService`, `IFileRepository`, etc.) are present with the correct method signatures as per the SDS.","Given the project source code, When I inspect the `Models` and `Exceptions` folders, Then the `SaveDataWrapper` DTO and `SaveDataCorruptionException` custom exception are implemented as specified.","Create .NET Standard 2.1 C# project. Create folder structure (`Interfaces`, `Repositories`, etc.). Define all core interfaces (`IPersistenceService`, `IFileRepository`, `IDataProtector`, `IMigrationService`, `IMigrationScript`, `IJsonSerializer`). Implement POCO for `SaveDataWrapper` and custom `SaveDataCorruptionException`.","The .csproj file is configured and builds successfully. All specified interfaces, data models, and custom exceptions are created in the correct namespaces and files. The entire solution is committed to source control.
US-002,Data Persistence Implementation,Implement a JSON serialization service,Developer,"As a Developer, I want a dedicated serialization service that wraps a third-party library so that the core logic is decoupled from the specific JSON implementation.",Must Have,2,US-001,"Given a C# object, When I call the `Serialize` method, Then it returns a valid JSON string representation of the object.","Given a valid JSON string, When I call the `Deserialize<T>` method with the correct type, Then it returns a fully populated C# object of that type.","Given the `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer` is used, When a serialization or deserialization error occurs, Then it propagates the exception from the underlying library.","Implement the `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer` class which implements `IJsonSerializer`. It will be a thin wrapper around `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert` methods.","The `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer.cs` file is created and implements all methods of `IJsonSerializer`. Unit tests are written to verify both serialization and deserialization of a sample object.
US-003,Data Persistence Implementation,Implement non-blocking file system access,Developer,"As a Developer building for a game engine, I want a file repository that performs I/O operations asynchronously so that the game's main thread is not blocked, preventing freezes and stutters.",Must Have,5,US-001,"Given a file path and content, When `WriteAllTextAsync` is called, Then the content is written to the specified file on a background thread.","Given a file path for an existing file, When `ReadAllTextAsync` is called, Then the file's content is returned as a string from a background thread.","Given a file path, When `FileExists` is called, Then it synchronously returns true if the file exists and false otherwise.","Implement the `LocalFileRepository.cs` class. Use `System.IO.File` for I/O operations. Wrap synchronous calls in `Task.Run()` to ensure async methods are non-blocking. Construct file paths using `Path.Combine`.","The `LocalFileRepository.cs` class is implemented. Unit tests (potentially using a mocked file system) verify that async methods are non-blocking and that all interface methods work as expected.
US-004,Data Security and Integrity,Protect save data against casual tampering,Player,"As a Player, I want my save file to be protected from accidental corruption and simple editing so that my game progress is safe.",Should Have,8,US-001,"Given a clean JSON string, When the data is protected, Then the output is an obfuscated and Base64-encoded string.","Given a valid protected string, When it is unprotected, Then the original clean JSON string is returned.","Given a protected string that has been modified, When it is unprotected, Then a `SaveDataCorruptionException` is thrown.","Implement the `SimpleXorDataProtector` class. The Protect method will compute a SHA256 hash, prepend it to the data (`{hash}:{jsonData}`), XOR the result, and Base64 encode it. Unprotect will reverse the process and validate the hash.","The `SimpleXorDataProtector.cs` file is created and implements the `IDataProtector` interface. Unit tests verify the protect/unprotect roundtrip and confirm that tampered data throws a `SaveDataCorruptionException`.
US-005,"Data Schema Migration System",Enable automatic upgrades of save data,Player,"As a Player, I want my game progress to be automatically updated when I install a new version of the app so that I don't lose my progress due to changes in the save format.",Should Have,8,US-001,"Given save data from a previous version, When the data is loaded, Then the migration service correctly applies the necessary scripts in order to update it to the current version.","Given save data that is already the current version, When the data is loaded, Then the migration service performs no operations and returns the data unchanged.","Given a migration path is incomplete (a script is missing), When the migration is attempted, Then the system throws an exception and logs a critical error to prevent data corruption.","Implement the `MigrationService` to orchestrate scripts based on version. Implement an example `MigrationScript_V1_to_V2` to prove the system works by renaming a property in a JObject.","The `MigrationService` and `MigrationScript_V1_to_V2` classes are implemented. Unit tests verify that scripts are applied sequentially, no-op works correctly, and a broken migration chain throws an exception.
US-006,Data Persistence Implementation,Save player progress to a local file,Player,"As a Player, I want my progress, settings, and achievements to be saved when I close the game so that I can continue where I left off next time.",Must Have,8,"US-002,US-003,US-004","Given a `PlayerProfile` object, When `SavePlayerProfileAsync` is called, Then the data is serialized, protected, and written to the `player_profile.dat` file.","Given the save process, When inspecting the final file content, Then it is a JSON representation of the `SaveDataWrapper` containing the protected payload.","Given the dependencies are mocked, When `SavePlayerProfileAsync` is called, Then the `IJsonSerializer`, `IDataProtector`, and `IFileRepository` are called in the correct sequence with the expected data.","Implement the `SavePlayerProfileAsync` method in `PersistenceService`. This method will orchestrate the calls to the serializer, data protector, and file repository to correctly format and write the data to disk.","The `SavePlayerProfileAsync` method is fully implemented in `PersistenceService.cs`. Unit tests with mocked dependencies verify the complete orchestration logic from object to protected file content.
US-007,Data Persistence Implementation,Load player progress from a local file,Player,"As a Player, I want my progress to be loaded automatically when I start the game so that I can resume playing with all my previous achievements and settings.",Must Have,8,"US-004,US-005,US-006","Given a valid and up-to-date save file exists, When `LoadPlayerProfileAsync` is called, Then a fully populated `PlayerProfile` object is returned.","Given no save file exists, When `LoadPlayerProfileAsync` is called, Then a new, default `PlayerProfile` object is returned without errors.","Given a corrupt or tampered save file exists, When `LoadPlayerProfileAsync` is called, Then an error is logged and a new, default `PlayerProfile` is returned, preventing the game from crashing.","Implement the `LoadPlayerProfileAsync` method in `PersistenceService`. This method orchestrates reading the file, unprotecting the data, running it through the migration service, and deserializing the final object, with robust try-catch blocks.","The `LoadPlayerProfileAsync` method is fully implemented in `PersistenceService.cs`. Unit tests cover all scenarios: successful load, missing file, corrupt file, and a file requiring migration.
US-008,"In-Progress State Management",Resume an interrupted game session,Player,"As a Player, if my game closes unexpectedly during a level (e.g., due to a phone call or crash), I want to be able to resume from where I was so that I don't lose my progress on that level.",Could Have,5,US-007,"Given a `GameStateInProgress` object, When `SaveInProgressState` is called, Then the object is synchronously serialized and written to a temporary file (`gamestate.tmp`).","Given a temporary state file exists, When `LoadInProgressState` is called, Then the `GameStateInProgress` object is returned.","Given a level is completed or abandoned, When `ClearInProgressState` is called, Then the temporary state file is deleted.","Implement the synchronous methods in `PersistenceService`: `SaveInProgressState`, `LoadInProgressState`, `ClearInProgressState`, and `HasInProgressState`. These methods will perform simple serialization and file I/O.","All four in-progress state management methods are implemented in `PersistenceService.cs`. Unit tests verify the save, load, clear, and existence check functionalities.
US-009,"Quality Assurance & Testing",Verify the reliability of the persistence service,Development Team,"As a member of the Development Team, I want comprehensive unit tests for the `PersistenceService` so that I can refactor and add features with confidence, ensuring the core save/load logic remains robust.",Must Have,8,"US-007,US-008","Given the `PersistenceService` tests, When they are run, Then all success paths for saving and loading (including with migrations) are verified.","Given the `PersistenceService` tests, When they are run, Then all failure paths (file not found, data corruption) are verified to result in a new default profile without throwing unhandled exceptions.","Given the `PersistenceService` tests, When they are run, Then all logic paths for the in-progress state management (save, load, clear, has) are verified.","Create a test project using NUnit and a mocking library (e.g., Moq). Write extensive unit tests for `PersistenceService` by mocking all its dependencies to isolate its orchestration logic.","A test project is created and configured. `PersistenceServiceTests.cs` is implemented with high code coverage, testing all major success and failure scenarios for both player profile and in-progress state management. All tests pass.
US-010,"Quality Assurance & Testing",Verify the correctness of data protection and migration,Development Team,"As a member of the Development Team, I want targeted unit tests for the `SimpleXorDataProtector` and `MigrationService` so that I can ensure data integrity is maintained and schema upgrades work as expected.",Must Have,8,"US-004,US-005","Given the `SimpleXorDataProtectorTests`, When they are run, Then the protect/unprotect roundtrip is confirmed to work, and tampered data is confirmed to throw a `SaveDataCorruptionException`.","Given the `MigrationServiceTests` with mock scripts, When they are run, Then the service is confirmed to apply a single script, multiple scripts in the correct order, and no scripts when the data is already current.","Given the `MigrationServiceTests`, When a test simulates a missing script in the migration chain, Then the service is confirmed to throw the appropriate exception.","Write targeted unit tests for `SimpleXorDataProtector` and `MigrationService`. The migration tests will require creating mock `IMigrationScript` implementations to simulate different scenarios.","The files `SimpleXorDataProtectorTests.cs` and `MigrationServiceTests.cs` are implemented with high code coverage. All algorithmic and orchestration logic is verified. All tests pass.
