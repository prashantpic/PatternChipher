RISK-TEC-001,Technical,"The GameManager singleton implementation is complex and prone to common Unity errors like race conditions in Awake(), incorrect handling of duplicate instances, or DontDestroyOnLoad issues, leading to corrupted state or memory leaks.",4,5,20,High,"WI-CLIENT-001, WI-CLIENT-002, WI-CLIENT-003, WI-CLIENT-009, WI-CLIENT-010",Misunderstanding of the Unity object lifecycle and scene loading process; complexity of the singleton pattern in a scene-based engine.,Mandate peer code review for the GameManager. Use a well-documented, battle-tested singleton pattern. Implement 'Play Mode' tests to verify singleton behavior across multiple scene loads.,Allocate dedicated time for a 'stabilization sprint' to refactor the GameManager and AppInitializer. Consider a simpler Service Locator pattern as an alternative if the singleton becomes unmanageable.,QA reports of strange behavior after scene transitions (e.g., two audio managers). Automated tests checking for duplicate instances fail.,Lead Developer,TBD,Open
RISK-OPR-001,Operational,"The 'Bootstrap' scene's position as index 0 in the Build Settings is a manual step. This setting can be accidentally changed or not committed to version control, causing the wrong scene to load on start and breaking the entire initialization flow.",4,5,20,High,WI-CLIENT-010,"Reliance on manual Unity Editor settings that are prone to human error, merge conflicts, or incorrect version control configuration.",Implement a CI/CD pipeline step that programmatically verifies the scene at index 0 in the Build Settings is 'Bootstrap'. Document this critical step for all developers.,If a bad build is deployed, a hotfix correcting the Build Settings must be issued immediately. A post-mortem should be conducted to understand how the configuration error occurred.,CI pre-build script fails. Automated test checking `SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name` immediately after launch fails. App opens to the wrong screen.,Build Engineer,TBD,Open
RISK-QLT-001,Quality,"The GameManager state machine logic may contain bugs (e.g., incorrect transitions, failure to clean up state on exit), especially when interacting with asynchronous scene loading, leading to a soft-locked game.",4,4,16,High,WI-CLIENT-003,"Complexity of managing state transitions combined with asynchronous operations. Incomplete logic in the state-handling `switch` statement.",Implement extensive logging for every state entry, exit, and transition. Develop a suite of 'Play Mode' tests to force state changes and verify outcomes (e.g., Time.timeScale, loaded scene).,"Add a debug UI to manually force a state change to recover from soft-locks during testing. If issues persist, consider using a formal State Machine library instead of a manual implementation.",QA reports of the game getting stuck or UI becoming unresponsive. Log entries show an OnEnterState call without a corresponding OnExitState before the next transition.,Gameplay Programmer,TBD,Open
RISK-TEC-002,Technical,"Incorrectly configuring the PatternCipher.Client.asmdef file's references can lead to compilation errors, broken dependencies between layers, or unintended coupling, which violates the project's layered architecture.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-CLIENT-008,Lack of familiarity with Unity's assembly definition system; human error in a manual configuration step via the Inspector.,Create a clear architectural diagram showing all assembly dependencies. Perform a dedicated review of the .asmdef configuration against the diagram. Use a CI job to perform a clean build to immediately detect errors.,Revert the .asmdef change from version control. Manually edit the file to correct references. Temporarily disable 'overrideReferences' to allow compilation while the issue is fixed.,CI build failure with compilation errors related to missing type or namespace references.,Lead Developer,TBD,Open
RISK-TIM-001,Timeline,"The GameManager (WI-CLIENT-002) has a hard dependency on the `_persistenceService` which is from another repository. If the persistence layer is not implemented or is buggy, this core lifecycle functionality (saving progress) will be broken and untestable.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-CLIENT-002,Tight coupling to a service from another repository whose development schedule is not perfectly aligned.,Develop a mock/stub version of the `IPersistenceService` interface. This allows the GameManager's lifecycle hooks to be developed and tested in parallel before the real service is ready.,If the real service is significantly delayed, the mock service can be enhanced with basic PlayerPrefs functionality to allow for more comprehensive testing, with the real implementation swapped in later.,CI build fails because the IPersistenceService interface or implementation is not available. Cross-team standups reveal a schedule slip.,Project Manager,TBD,Open
RISK-PER-001,Performance,"The static GameEventSystem can cause memory leaks if objects subscribe to events but are destroyed without unsubscribing. This is a common error in Unity's component lifecycle.",3,3,9,Medium,WI-CLIENT-005,"Developers forgetting to pair `Subscribe` calls (e.g., in OnEnable) with `Unsubscribe` calls (in OnDisable/OnDestroy).",Enforce a strict coding standard requiring every `Subscribe` call to have a corresponding `Unsubscribe`. Use automated static analysis tools to find classes with subscriptions but no unsubscriptions. Use the Unity Profiler to check for listener counts.,"Implement a 'WeakReference' version of the event system so that destroyed subscribers are automatically garbage collected. Refactor specific high-frequency events to use direct callbacks.",The Unity Memory Profiler shows an increasing number of listeners for a specific event over time during a play session.,Lead Developer,TBD,Open
RISK-QLT-002,Quality,"Asynchronous scene loading might not correctly synchronize with the GameManager's state machine or UI animations, causing visual glitches like the loading screen disappearing too early or a 'flash' of the old scene.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-CLIENT-003, WI-CLIENT-007",Race conditions between the async `Task` completing, the `GameState` changing, and the UI service hiding the loading screen animation.,Design a clear event sequence for scene loading: 1. BeginSceneTransition event (show loading screen). 2. Call `SceneLoader.LoadSceneAsync`. 3. Await the task. 4. Publish `SceneLoadComplete` event. 5. UI listens for this to hide the screen.,Implement a simple, fixed-duration delay after scene loading before hiding the loading screen to mask minor timing issues. Use a callback system instead of relying purely on awaiting the Task.,QA reports of flickering or objects from the old scene being visible for a frame in the new scene. Loading screen hiding before the new scene is interactive.,UI Programmer,TBD,Open
RISK-RES-001,Resource,"Several high-complexity tasks require a combination of specialized skills (Unity, C#, State Machine Pattern). A dependency on a single developer with this expertise creates a project bottleneck.",2,4,8,Medium,"WI-CLIENT-002, WI-CLIENT-003",Concentration of critical, specialized knowledge in a single individual.,Enforce pair programming for the most complex tasks (GameManager). Ensure thorough documentation and code comments for all core systems. Conduct internal knowledge-sharing sessions on the implemented patterns.,Cross-train another developer on the core architecture. Allocate budget for external consultation if the key person becomes unavailable for an extended period.,Project velocity drops significantly when a specific team member is on leave. One developer is consistently the only one reviewing or committing to core systems.,Team Lead,TBD,Open
RISK-TEC-003,Technical,"SceneId and GameState enums could fall out of sync with the actual scene files in the project or the states handled in the state machine, leading to runtime errors when loading a non-existent scene or entering an unhandled state.",2,3,6,Low,"WI-CLIENT-004, WI-CLIENT-003, WI-CLIENT-007",Manual process of keeping enum definitions synchronized with project assets and code logic; human error.,Implement an editor script that runs pre-build to verify that all `SceneId` enum values correspond to a scene in the Build Settings. Add a `default` case to the state machine's switch statement to catch and log unhandled states.,If an invalid scene is requested, the SceneLoader should gracefully fail and log a detailed error instead of crashing. Unhandled states should transition to a safe 'Error' state that displays a message to the user.,An `ArgumentException` or `NullReferenceException` is thrown when trying to load a scene. The `default` case in the state machine is triggered in the logs.,Gameplay Programmer,TBD,Open
