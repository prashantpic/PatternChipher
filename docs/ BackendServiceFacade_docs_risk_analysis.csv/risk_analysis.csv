RISK-001,Technical,"The FirebaseInitializer (WI-003) fails to complete, particularly on Android devices, due to missing or outdated Google Play Services. This failure would prevent the entire application from connecting to any backend service, rendering it unusable for online features.",3,5,15,High,"WI-003, WI-004, WI-007, WI-008, WI-009","External dependency on the state of the user's device and the complex, asynchronous nature of the `CheckAndFixDependenciesAsync` SDK call at app startup.",Implement robust error handling in `FirebaseInitializer` to display a user-friendly message guiding them to update Google Play Services. Use a static `TaskCompletionSource` to ensure initialization logic runs only once and can be awaited safely by all other services.,"The application must gracefully degrade, disabling all online features but allowing offline gameplay (if applicable). A global status flag should be set to prevent services from attempting to call a non-initialized SDK.",A spike in startup-related crashes or errors in Firebase Crashlytics. User reports of being stuck on the loading screen.,Tech Lead,2024-08-15,Open
RISK-002,Quality,"The Firebase SDK classes are not designed for easy mocking (e.g., sealed classes, non-virtual methods, static accessors), making it difficult to write effective, isolated unit tests for the adapters. This weakens test quality and reliability.",4,3,12,Medium,WI-012,"The design of the third-party Firebase SDK is not optimized for testability, creating a tight coupling that is hard to break in a testing environment.",Create an additional thin wrapper layer with interfaces (e.g., `IFirebaseAuthWrapper`) around the core Firebase SDK static classes. The adapters will depend on these mockable wrappers, not the SDK directly.,"Reduce the scope of unit tests to only cover logic that doesn't touch the SDK (e.g., mappers). Increase the scope and number of integration tests (WI-013) to cover the logic, accepting the slower feedback loop and higher cost.",Unit test development for an adapter takes significantly longer than estimated. Developers report inability to mock specific SDK methods.,Tech Lead,2024-09-01,Open
RISK-003,External,"Configuration for third-party authentication providers (Google, Apple) is complex and managed across multiple external consoles (Firebase, Google Cloud, Apple Developer). Misconfiguration is common and will cause a specific sign-in method to fail completely.",4,4,16,High,WI-004,"The complexity and distributed nature of OAuth provider configuration, which is external to the codebase and requires manual setup of keys, IDs, and fingerprints.",Create a detailed, step-by-step configuration checklist in the project's wiki for setting up a new environment (dev, prod). Automate the generation of config files (e.g., `google-services.json`) via a CI/CD script where possible.,"If a provider's sign-in is broken in production, remotely disable that sign-in option via Firebase Remote Config to prevent user frustration while a fix is being worked on. Communicate the issue to users via an in-app message.",A sudden drop in successful sign-in events for a specific provider in Firebase Analytics. An increase in auth-related exceptions in Crashlytics.,Tech Lead,2024-08-20,Open
RISK-004,Technical,"Developers fail to consistently catch all possible `FirebaseException` types and wrap them in the custom `FirebaseResult.Failure` object, leading to unhandled exceptions that crash the application during asynchronous operations.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-004, WI-007, WI-009","Lack of a strictly enforced, standardized `try-catch` pattern for all async SDK calls, combined with the variety of exceptions the SDK can throw.",Create a shared helper method, e.g., `async Task<FirebaseResult<T>> TryFirebaseCallAsync(Func<Task<T>> firebaseTask)`, that encapsulates the try-catch-wrap logic. Enforce its use through code reviews and static analysis rules.,"Implement a global unhandled exception handler in Unity (`Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded`) that logs the raw exception to Crashlytics, allowing for post-release detection and patching of uncaught exceptions.",Appearance of raw `FirebaseException` or `AggregateException` types in Crashlytics reports.,Tech Lead,2024-08-25,Open
RISK-005,Quality,"Integration tests (WI-013) that run against a live Firebase project are flaky due to network latency, intermittent backend errors, or test data state issues. This erodes trust in the CI/CD pipeline and can hide real bugs.",4,3,12,Medium,WI-013,"Dependencies on external systems (network, Firebase backend) which are not 100% reliable. Potential for state pollution between test runs, where one test's data affects another's outcome.",Design integration tests to be idempotent and self-contained. Each test should create its own unique data (e.g., a new random user for auth tests) and clean it up afterwards. Implement retry logic for network-related failures. Set up Firebase budget alerts.,"Run the test suite against the Firebase Local Emulator Suite in the CI/CD environment. This provides a local, high-fidelity environment that eliminates network flakiness and cost, while still testing against real Firebase APIs.",The CI/CD pipeline fails intermittently on the integration test step. Receiving a budget alert email from the Google Cloud project used for testing.,QA Lead,2024-09-15,Open
RISK-006,Technical,"The C# `PlayerProfileDto` (WI-005) is modified without a corresponding data migration plan. When existing users update the app, the client fails to deserialize the old data structure from Firestore, leading to data loss or crashes.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-005, WI-007","The data schema is defined only in client code, with no versioning or backward compatibility considerations. Manual updates to DTOs are made without analyzing the impact on existing, in-flight data.",Maintain a version number field within the Firestore document. On load, the client should check this version and, if it's an old version, run a specific migration function to transform the loaded data into the current schema before using it.,"If a breaking change is deployed, a hotfix must be rolled out immediately to either revert the change or implement the necessary client-side data migration logic. A one-off backend script may be required to fix corrupted data in Firestore for affected users.",A spike in Firestore deserialization failures or permission errors logged in the client. Users reporting that their progress has been lost or reset after an update.,Tech Lead,2024-09-10,Open
RISK-007,Quality,"The `PlayerProfileMapper` (WI-006) is updated to handle changes in the Domain model or DTO, but a field is accidentally missed. This results in the silent data loss of that specific field during a save/load cycle.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-006, WI-007","Manual, bi-directional mapping is error-prone. Lack of automated checks to ensure that all properties on the source object have a corresponding mapping to the destination object.",Implement a unit test for the mapper that uses reflection to get all property names from both the domain and DTO objects. The test will assert that the lists of property names (excluding explicitly ignored ones) are identical to ensure no field is missed.,"If data loss is discovered post-release, deploy a hotfix with the corrected mapper. A backend script might be needed to attempt data recovery from Firestore backups (if enabled and available) for the affected users.",Users complaining about specific, non-critical pieces of their progress not being saved (e.g., 'I changed a cosmetic item, but it resets every time').,QA Lead,2024-09-05,Open
RISK-008,External,"A future update to the Firebase SDKs or the Unity Editor's .NET runtime introduces breaking API changes, causing the library to fail to compile or function correctly. This could block the project from adopting new Unity versions.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-001, EPIC-001, EPIC-002","Tight coupling between the library and external dependencies (Firebase, Unity) whose release cycles and API stability are outside the project's control.",Wrap SDK calls in adapters (as designed) to limit the surface area of impact. Maintain a dedicated CI job that attempts to build the library against Unity's beta releases to get early warnings of breaking changes.,"Allocate specific 'tech debt' sprints in the project roadmap for resolving incompatibilities after a mandatory engine or SDK upgrade. If a feature is broken, use Remote Config to disable it temporarily.",Build failures or compilation errors immediately after upgrading the project's Unity Editor version or Firebase SDK packages. Review of release notes for new versions indicates breaking changes.,Tech Lead,2024-10-01,Open
