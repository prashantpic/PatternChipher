# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . CI/CD Build, Test, and Deploy Pipeline
  Models the automated workflow from a developer committing code to a new build being deployed to a staging environment. This sequence shows the interaction between version control, the CI/CD orchestrator, testing frameworks, and infrastructure provisioning.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To document the core DevOps process that ensures consistent, reliable, and automated software delivery for both the client application and backend services.

  #### .5. Type
  BusinessProcess

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-PATT-DEVOPS-001
  - REPO-PATT-001
  - REPO-PATT-008
  - REPO-PATT-INFRA-001
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Developer pushes code to a feature branch and creates a pull request.
  - The PR triggers a workflow in CICD-Pipelines (GitHub Actions).
  - The pipeline checks out the code and runs unit tests on the relevant repositories (e.g., REPO-PATT-002).
  - Upon merge to a release branch, a new workflow is triggered.
  - The pipeline builds the GameClientApplication for iOS and Android.
  - It then deploys the serverless functions from LeaderboardServiceEndpoints.
  - It may trigger a plan/apply on the InfrastructureAsCode repository to update Firebase rules.
  - Finally, it uploads the client builds to TestFlight and Google Play Internal Testing.
  
  #### .8. Related Feature Ids
