# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Offline Procedural Level Gameplay Loop
  Details the core gameplay loop for a player playing a level without an internet connection. It covers procedural level generation, guaranteeing solvability with an integrated solver, handling player moves, checking for level completion, and saving progress locally.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To model the primary, self-contained gameplay experience, ensuring the core logic for puzzle generation, solving, and completion is robust and independent of online services.

  #### .5. Type
  FeatureFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-PATT-001
  - REPO-PATT-003
  - REPO-PATT-002
  - REPO-PATT-004
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - User selects a level via UserInterfaceEndpoints.
  - GameClientApplication requests a new level from GameplayLogicEndpoints.
  - GameplayLogicEndpoints procedurally generates a puzzle grid and goal.
  - An integrated solver within GameplayLogicEndpoints verifies solvability and calculates the 'par' move count.
  - User interacts with the UI, which translates inputs into move requests (swap, tap).
  - GameplayLogicEndpoints validates moves and updates the grid state.
  - After each move, GameplayLogicEndpoints checks if the goal condition is met.
  - Upon completion, the score is calculated and GameClientApplication triggers a local save via LocalPersistenceEndpoints.
