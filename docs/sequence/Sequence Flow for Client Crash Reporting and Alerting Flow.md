# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Client Crash Reporting and Alerting Flow
  Illustrates the lifecycle of an application crash, from the unhandled exception on a user's device to the development team being alerted of a spike in a new crash signature.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To model the critical observability and incident response process for client application stability, which is key to maintaining a high-quality user experience.

  #### .5. Type
  ServiceInteraction

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-PATT-001
  - REPO-PATT-005
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - An unhandled exception occurs in the GameClientApplication.
  - The integrated Firebase Crashlytics SDK (part of BackendServiceFacade) catches the exception.
  - On the next application launch, the SDK sends the crash report (including stack trace and custom keys) to the Firebase backend.
  - Firebase Crashlytics processes the report, deobfuscates the stack trace, and groups it with similar crashes.
  - If the crash is new or its frequency exceeds a configured threshold, Firebase sends an alert to a configured channel (e.g., email, Slack).
  - A developer investigates the grouped crash report in the Firebase console.
