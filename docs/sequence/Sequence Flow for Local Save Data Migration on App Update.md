  ### . Local Save Data Migration on App Update
  Details the process that occurs when a user launches the app for the first time after an update that includes a change to the local save data schema. It shows how the system detects the old version and robustly migrates it to the new format.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To ensure player progress is preserved across application updates, a critical factor for user retention. This models a key operational requirement for game maintenance.

  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - GameClientApplication starts up.
  - It requests the player profile from LocalPersistenceEndpoints.
  - LocalPersistenceEndpoints loads the raw save file and checks the 'saveschemaversion' field.
  - It detects the version is older than the current application's expected version.
  - It creates a backup of the old save file.
  - It runs a sequence of migration scripts to transform the old data structure to the new one in memory.
  - It saves the newly structured data to the primary save file.
  - It returns the migrated player profile to the GameClientApplication.
