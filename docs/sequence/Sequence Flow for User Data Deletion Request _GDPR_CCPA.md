# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . User Data Deletion Request (GDPR/CCPA)
  Models the backend process for handling a user's 'right to be forgotten' request. This is a security and compliance critical flow, triggered by an administrative action, which orchestrates the deletion of all user data across multiple Firebase services.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To document the critical compliance workflow for data privacy regulations, ensuring all personal identifiable information (PII) is correctly and completely erased from the backend.

  #### .5. Type
  SecurityFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-PATT-011
  - REPO-PATT-007
  - REPO-PATT-006
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - A data deletion request is triggered for a specific Firebase UID (e.g., via an admin tool or support process).
  - The UserAccountManagementFunction is invoked with the target UID.
  - The function uses the Firebase Admin SDK to delete the user's document from CloudDataEndpoints (Firestore), which contains their cloud save and other profile data.
  - The function queries and deletes all leaderboard entries associated with the UID from CloudDataEndpoints.
  - The function calls AuthenticationServiceEndpoints to permanently delete the user's account.
  - The function writes to an audit log upon successful completion.

  #### .10. Metadata
  
  - **Complexity:** Medium
  - **Priority:** Critical
