# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
BackendServiceFacade


---

# 2. Description
A client-side infrastructure component that acts as a facade to all Firebase backend services. It abstracts the specifics of the Firebase SDKs, providing a clean, domain-centric interface for other client services to use for authentication, cloud save, leaderboard access, analytics, and remote configuration. This is the sole entry point from the client to the backend.
