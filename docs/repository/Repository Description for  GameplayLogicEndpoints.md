# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
GameplayLogicEndpoints


---

# 2. Description
Represents the core domain logic of the game, completely decoupled from the presentation layer. These endpoints expose the functional capabilities for procedural level generation, puzzle solvability validation via an integrated solver, evaluation of puzzle rules, and scoring calculations. This module is platform-agnostic, ensuring the core game rules can be tested independently of the Unity engine.
