# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
FirebaseBackendMaster


---

# 2. Description
This is the functional master repository for the entire Firebase serverless backend application. It serves as the primary container and coordinator for all server-side logic and configuration. Its responsibilities include housing the source code for all individual Cloud Functions (like those for leaderboards and user account management), defining shared backend utilities and libraries (e.g., common data models, custom validation helpers, error handling middleware), and managing the core Firebase project deployment configuration files (firebase.json, .firebaserc, firestore.rules, firestore.indexes.json).

By centralizing these components, this repository ensures a consistent, organized, and maintainable backend structure. It orchestrates the development, testing, and deployment of all serverless modules, preventing code duplication and streamlining the CI/CD process for the backend. It acts as the single source of truth for the entire server-side application, coordinating the individual functional endpoints defined in repositories like REPO-PATT-008 and REPO-PATT-011 into a cohesive whole.
