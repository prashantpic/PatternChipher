US-001,EPIC-RC-001,"Establish Foundational Remote Config File","Developer","As a Developer, I want to initialize the repository and create the basic remote config file with its version and feature flags, so that we have a version-controlled foundation for all dynamic game configurations.","Must Have",2,"","Given the project's source control, When I check for the `REPO-PATT-009` repository, Then it must exist and contain the directory structure `firebase/remote-config/`.","Given the `remote_config_template.json` file, When I inspect its content, Then its root must be a JSON object containing the key `schemaVersion` with the string value ""1.0.0"".","Given the `remote_config_template.json` file, When I inspect the `featureFlags` key, Then it must be a JSON object containing all the boolean flags (`isCloudSaveEnabled`, `isLeaderboardsEnabled`, etc.) as specified in the SDS.","WI-RC-111, WI-RC-112, WI-RC-113","The `remote_config_template.json` file exists in the correct repository and directory, and contains a valid root object with `schemaVersion` and the complete `featureFlags` structure. Code is merged to the main branch."
US-002,EPIC-RC-001,"Define Core Game Balancing and Progression Parameters","Game Designer","As a Game Designer, I want to define the initial scoring, difficulty, and content progression rules in the remote config file, so that I can establish the baseline for player challenge, rewards, and the introduction of new mechanics.","Must Have",5,US-001,"Given the `remote_config_template.json` file, When the `scoringRules` object is inspected, Then it must exist and its structure must exactly match the SDS, including all nested properties like `baseScorePerLevel` and `starThresholds` with correct data types.","Given the `remote_config_template.json` file, When the `difficultyTiers` array is inspected, Then it must exist and contain at least one valid tier object (e.g., 'BEGINNER') with all required keys like `tierId`, `gridSizeRange`, and `symbolCountRange`.","Given the `remote_config_template.json` file, When the `pcgRules` object is inspected, Then it must exist and contain a `controlledIntroduction` array with objects specifying element unlocks as per the SDS.","WI-RC-114, WI-RC-115, WI-RC-116","The `remote_config_template.json` file is updated to include the complete and correctly structured `scoringRules`, `difficultyTiers`, and `pcgRules` sections as per the SDS. Code is merged to the main branch."
US-003,EPIC-RC-002,"Implement Automated Configuration Syntax Validation","Developer","As a Developer, I want a CI job that automatically validates the syntax of the remote config file on every pull request, so that we can prevent merging broken configurations that would cause errors in the game client.","Must Have",2,US-001,"Given a developer creates a Pull Request with a syntactically valid `remote_config_template.json`, When the CI pipeline runs, Then a 'JSON Validation' check must pass.","Given a developer creates a Pull Request with a syntactically invalid `remote_config_template.json`, When the CI pipeline runs, Then the 'JSON Validation' check must fail, blocking the merge.","Given a Pull Request that does not modify `remote_config_template.json` is created, When the CI pipeline runs, Then the 'JSON Validation' check should pass or be gracefully skipped.","WI-RC-211","A CI job is implemented and configured as a required check for all PRs. The job correctly passes for valid JSON and fails for invalid JSON in the config file."
US-004,EPIC-RC-002,"Implement Automated Deployment to Staging Environment","Live-Ops Manager","As a Live-Ops Manager, I want configuration changes to be automatically deployed to our staging environment upon merge, so that the QA team can immediately begin testing the impact of the changes without manual intervention.","Must Have",5,US-003,"Given a valid Pull Request is merged into the main branch, When the CI/CD pipeline is triggered, Then a 'Deploy to Staging' job must run successfully.","Given the 'Deploy to Staging' job runs, When it completes, Then the Firebase Remote Config for the staging project must be updated with the exact contents of the `remote_config_template.json` from the merged branch.","Given the 'Deploy to Staging' job encounters an error (e.g., authentication failure, invalid config), When the pipeline runs, Then the job must fail and send a notification to the development team.","WI-RC-212","A CI/CD pipeline is in place that successfully deploys the `remote_config_template.json` to the staging Firebase project on every merge to the main branch. Secrets are securely managed."
US-005,EPIC-RC-003,"Document Repository Purpose and Basic Usage","New Developer","As a New Developer, I want a clear README file in the repository, so that I can quickly understand the purpose of the configuration file and the high-level process for making changes.","Should Have",1,"","Given a user navigates to the root of the `REPO-PATT-009` repository, When they view the contents, Then a `README.md` file must be present.","Given the `README.md` is opened, When its content is read, Then it must clearly explain that the repository is for managing Firebase Remote Config via a `configuration-as-code` approach.","Given the `README.md` is opened, When its content is read, Then it must provide a brief overview of the change management process (PR -> Review -> Staging -> Production) and link to more detailed documentation.","WI-RC-311","A `README.md` file is present in the repository's root, is well-written, and meets all criteria. The file is merged into the main branch."
US-006,EPIC-RC-003,"Document Production Deployment and Rollback Procedure","Live-Ops Manager","As a Live-Ops Manager, I want a detailed, step-by-step guide for promoting a validated configuration to production and rolling it back, so that I can perform these critical live operations safely and consistently, minimizing the risk of errors.","Should Have",3,US-004,"Given an authorized user needs to deploy a config to production, When they access the project documentation, Then they must find a document titled 'Production Deployment Guide' (or similar).","Given the guide is opened, When the user follows the 'Promotion' steps, Then the instructions must clearly guide them on how to publish the staging configuration to the production Firebase project, including authorization details.","Given the guide is opened, When the user follows the 'Rollback' steps, Then the instructions must provide a clear, unambiguous plan to immediately revert to the previous known-good configuration using the Firebase console's version history.","WI-RC-312","A clear, step-by-step document for production promotion and rollback exists, has been reviewed for clarity, and is accessible to authorized personnel. The document is stored in the project's designated documentation space (e.g., wiki, Confluence)."
