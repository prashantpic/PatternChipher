RISK-TEC-001,Technical,"The A* pathfinding algorithm in `AStarSolver` (WI-GEN-004) is highly complex and may be implemented incorrectly, leading to false solvability reports or non-optimal 'par' values, breaking the core puzzle generation loop.",4,5,20,High,"WI-GEN-004, WI-GEN-003, WI-QA-005","High algorithmic complexity and sensitivity to off-by-one errors in heuristic calculation, state management, or path reconstruction.",1. Mandate a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with a pre-defined set of test cases for known solvable/unsolvable puzzles. 2. Require a formal code review for the `AStarSolver` implementation by a second senior developer. 3. Implement the heuristic function as a separate, independently testable unit.,"If the A* implementation is not stable, revert to a simpler, guaranteed-correct algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for validation. This will find a solution, though not necessarily the optimal one, unblocking the generator. The 'par' value can be set to the BFS path length.",Unit tests for `AStarSolver` fail to produce the expected optimal path for a known puzzle, or integration tests in `WI-QA-005` report unsolvable puzzles.,Tech Lead,2024-08-01,Identified
RISK-TEC-002,Technical,"The `AStarSolver`'s performance may be inadequate for larger or more complex puzzles, causing puzzle generation to time out and fail, impacting the user experience in the client application.",4,4,16,High,"WI-GEN-004, WI-GEN-003","Exponential growth of the search space with grid size or move complexity. An inefficient heuristic function or data structure choice (e.g., using a List instead of a Priority Queue for the open set) can drastically slow down the search.","1. Implement the 'open set' using an efficient Priority Queue data structure. 2. Define and run performance benchmarks as part of the CI process for `WI-QA-005`. 3. The `DifficultyProfile` must include a maximum complexity setting to cap the search space.",1. If benchmarks fail, profile the solver to identify bottlenecks and optimize. 2. If optimization is insufficient, the `PuzzleGenerator` will be updated to impose stricter limits on generation parameters (e.g., fewer reverse moves) to reduce the search depth required. 3. Introduce a timeout in the `PuzzleGenerator` to abandon and retry generation if the solver takes too long.,The average generation time for a puzzle of medium difficulty exceeds 500ms on the CI server.,Dev Team Lead,2024-08-08,Identified
RISK-TEC-003,Technical,"The `Puzzle` aggregate root (WI-DOM-003) may fail to properly protect its invariants, for example, by returning a mutable reference to the internal `Grid` state from `GetGridState()`, allowing external code to bypass game logic and corrupt the puzzle's state.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-DOM-003, WI-DOM-002, WI-MECH-002","Lack of adherence to Domain-Driven Design principles, specifically the rules of aggregate encapsulation. Developer oversight in returning a direct reference instead of a copy or read-only view.","1. Mandate in the pull request template that all public methods returning complex state must return immutable copies or read-only interfaces. 2. Write a specific unit test (`WI-QA-003`) that attempts to mutate the state of the grid returned from `GetGridState()` and asserts that the aggregate's internal state remains unchanged.",If a state corruption bug is found post-merge, a hotfix will be prioritized to implement the correct defensive copy/read-only wrapper pattern.,A code review identifies a method returning a direct reference to an internal collection or entity, or a unit test successfully modifies the aggregate's internal state from the outside.,Tech Lead,2024-07-25,Identified
RISK-TIM-001,Timeline,"The complexity of `AStarSolver` (WI-GEN-004) and `PuzzleGenerator` (WI-GEN-003) is rated 'High', leading to a very high probability of estimation error and significant schedule delays for the entire project.",5,3,15,High,"WI-GEN-003, WI-GEN-004, EPIC-GEN-001","Over-optimism in estimating tasks that involve complex algorithms and state management. Unforeseen edge cases in the generation/solving loop requiring extensive debugging.","1. Timebox an initial proof-of-concept (PoC) for the `AStarSolver` to better gauge its complexity. 2. Break down `WI-GEN-004` into smaller sub-tasks (e.g., State Representation, Heuristic Function, Search Loop, Path Reconstruction). 3. Allocate a 25% buffer to the estimates for these specific work items.",If the PoC indicates a significant overrun, the project plan will be revised. Feature scope for the initial release may be reduced (e.g., launching with only 'Direct Match' puzzles and deferring more complex 'Rule-Based' types).,The `AStarSolver` PoC exceeds its allocated timebox by more than 20%.,Project Manager,2024-07-29,Identified
RISK-RES-001,Resource,"The project requires specialized skills in 'Algorithm Design' and 'Domain-Driven Design'. A lack of available expertise could lead to poor quality implementation, technical debt, and delays.",3,4,12,Medium,"WS-DOM-001, WS-GEN-001, WS-GEN-002","A small team or one where developers are generalists may not have deep experience in these specific, critical areas. The primary developer assigned may be unfamiliar with the nuances of A* or DDD aggregates.","1. Conduct a skills assessment before assigning tasks from `EPIC-GEN-001` and `EPIC-DOM-001`. 2. Enforce pair programming on the most complex work items (`WI-GEN-004`, `WI-DOM-003`). 3. Allocate budget for targeted online training or a consultation with a subject matter expert if a gap is identified.",If the initial implementation quality is low, reassign the task to a more senior developer or bring in external help. Accept a schedule slip to ensure the core logic is implemented correctly.,The first pull request for a complex task (e.g., `Grid` entity) shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the required design pattern (e.g., DDD).,Team Lead,2024-07-22,Identified
RISK-QUA-001,Quality,"The integration test for puzzle generation (`WI-QA-005`) may not cover sufficient edge cases, allowing bugs (like generating unsolvable puzzles or puzzles that are too simple) to pass into the main application.",4,4,16,High,"WI-QA-005, WI-GEN-003","The non-deterministic nature of procedural generation makes it difficult to create exhaustive tests. The test might only check for basic solvability and not for the quality or non-triviality of the generated puzzle.","1. The integration test must not only check for solvability but also assert that the generated `SolutionPath.Par` meets the `DifficultyProfile.MinimumSolutionMoves`. 2. Implement property-based testing where the generator is run hundreds of times with varied `DifficultyProfile` inputs, and assertions are made on the output. 3. Manually create a set of known 'tricky' puzzle states to validate the solver against.",If unsolvable puzzles are reported from the client application, a high-priority bug fix will be initiated. A logging mechanism will be added to the generator to save the seed and parameters of any failed generation attempts for later analysis.,An unsolvable or trivial puzzle is encountered during manual QA or dogfooding of the Unity client application.,QA Lead,2024-08-15,Identified
RISK-OPE-001,Operational,"The domain logic, particularly the `AStarSolver`, may have high memory usage due to storing numerous grid states in its search sets, leading to poor performance or crashes in the memory-constrained Unity mobile client.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-GEN-004, REPO-PATT-001","The A* algorithm's open and closed sets can grow very large. Each node in the search graph is a full copy of the `Grid` state, leading to significant memory allocation, which triggers expensive garbage collection (GC) in Unity, causing frame rate stuttering.","1. During implementation, ensure grid states are as lightweight as possible. 2. Implement memory profiling as part of the `AStarSolver` benchmark tests. 3. The consuming Unity application must call the puzzle generator during non-critical moments (e.g., on a loading screen) rather than during active gameplay.",If memory profiling shows excessive allocations, investigate state-sharing techniques (e.g., copy-on-write) or use a more memory-efficient representation for nodes in the search algorithm. As a last resort, limit the maximum grid size in the `DifficultyProfile`.,Memory profiler in Unity shows GC spikes correlated with calls to the puzzle generation logic, or the benchmark test shows allocations exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., 5MB per generation).,Tech Lead,2024-08-12,Identified
RISK-EXT-001,External,"The project depends on interfaces and data structures from a shared library (`REPO-PATT-012`, SharedKernel). Changes, delays, or ill-defined contracts in that repository can block development and cause significant rework.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-DOM-003, WI-MECH-003, WI-QA-001","Poor cross-team communication or planning. The `SharedKernel` team might change an interface like `IPuzzleGoal` or `IPuzzleRule` without coordinating, breaking all dependent implementations in this repository.","1. Establish a clear contract and versioning policy for the `SharedKernel` library. 2. Hold a joint design session between the teams to finalize the interfaces (`IPuzzleGoal`, `Tile`, `Move`, `IPuzzleRule`) before implementation begins. 3. Use a pre-release or specific version of the `SharedKernel` package to avoid being broken by ongoing development.",If the `SharedKernel` API changes unexpectedly, create a temporary adapter/facade within this project to isolate the change and allow development to continue while the dependency is stabilized.,A build fails due to a breaking change in the referenced `SharedKernel` project, or a required interface (`IPuzzleRule`) is not available when `WI-MECH-003` is scheduled to start.,Team Lead,2024-07-24,Identified
RISK-TEC-004,Technical,"The logic for the `RuleBasedGoalEvaluator` (WI-MECH-003) is generic and its correctness is entirely dependent on the concrete `IPuzzleRule` implementations (defined in SharedKernel). A bug in any single rule can make puzzles of that type unsolvable or incorrectly auto-solved.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-MECH-003","The complexity is displaced to the concrete rule classes. Each rule is a potential point of failure, and the combinatorial effect of multiple rules can lead to emergent bugs that are hard to foresee.",1. Mandate that every single `IPuzzleRule` implementation must have its own dedicated suite of unit tests in the `SharedKernel` repository. 2. The `RuleBasedGoalEvaluator`'s own tests must use mock `IPuzzleRule` objects that return true/false to ensure its orchestration logic is correct independently of the rules themselves.","If a rule-based puzzle type is found to be buggy, it will be disabled via a remote configuration flag in the client application until a fix can be deployed for the underlying `IPuzzleRule` implementation.",A specific type of rule-based puzzle is reported as being unsolvable or behaving incorrectly during QA testing.,QA Lead,2024-08-10,Identified
