TASK-RC-101,"Initialize Repository, Directory, and Base JSON File",DevOps,Git,Low,1.67,Mid,1,US-001,Yes,"Requires Docker Desktop installation. Foundational task assigned to a DevOps role to ensure proper repository setup and permissions.","Use a pre-defined project template or scaffold to automate the repository and directory creation."
TASK-RC-102,"Define and Populate featureFlags Section",Backend Development,"JSON,Game Design",Medium,2.17,Junior,1,"TASK-RC-101",No,"Use placeholder values if designer feedback is delayed. Requires collaboration between a developer and a game designer.","Create a simple web form for the game designer to input feature flags, which generates the JSON snippet, reducing developer involvement for value changes."
TASK-RC-103,"Define and Populate scoringRules Section",Backend Development,"JSON,Game Design",Medium,3.33,Junior,1,"TASK-RC-101",No,"Use a JSON schema validator or linter in the IDE to catch errors early. Game designer provides the balancing numbers, developer implements the structure.","Use a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets) for designers to manage scoring values, with a script to convert it to the required JSON structure."
TASK-RC-104,"Define and Populate difficultyTiers Section",Backend Development,"JSON,Game Design",High,5.17,Mid,1,"TASK-RC-101",No,"Create and validate a single object first, then place it in the array. This is a complex nested structure requiring careful validation.","Develop a small utility or script to validate the logic of difficulty tiers (e.g., ensure ranges don't overlap improperly) before committing."
TASK-RC-105,"Define and Populate pcgRules Section",Backend Development,"JSON,Game Design",High,5,Mid,1,"TASK-RC-101",No,"Document the meaning of 'elementId' values in code comments or the PR description. This directly impacts the player's progression experience.","Instead of manual JSON editing, create a GUI for designers to link unlockable elements ('elementId') to progression milestones ('unlocksAtLevel')."
TASK-RC-201,"Create CI Job for JSON Syntax Validation on Pull Requests",DevOps,"CI/CD (GitHub Actions),YAML,Shell Scripting",High,5.17,Mid,1,"TASK-RC-101",Yes,"Create two test PRs: one with valid JSON (must pass) and one with invalid JSON (must fail). This is a key risk mitigation task (RC-RISK-001).","Use a pre-existing, marketplace GitHub Action for JSON validation to reduce custom scripting."
TASK-RC-301,"Create Repository README.md File",Product Management,"Technical Writing,Markdown",Medium,3.17,Mid,1,"TASK-RC-101",No,"Peer review of the README.md file for clarity and completeness. Can be done by a developer or a product manager with strong technical writing skills.","Generate the initial README from a template and have multiple team members contribute sections relevant to their roles (DevOps, Game Design)."
TASK-RC-202,"Create CI Job for Automated Staging Deployment on Merge",DevOps,"CI/CD (GitHub Actions),YAML,Firebase CLI,Shell Scripting",High,9.33,Senior,1,"TASK-RC-201",Yes,"Pin the Firebase CLI version in the workflow to prevent unexpected breaking changes. Implement monitoring and alerts on the CI job's failure. This is a complex task requiring secure handling of staging credentials.","Use a dedicated deployment service or a GitOps-style operator that watches the repo and applies changes automatically."
TASK-RC-302,"Document the Production Deployment and Rollback Process",DevOps,"Technical Writing,Firebase",High,7.5,Senior,1,"TASK-RC-202",Yes,"A peer (ideally someone who would perform the role) must review the document and confirm they can follow the steps without ambiguity. A dry-run against the staging environment is recommended. Mitigates RC-RISK-008.","Create a video walkthrough of the process in addition to the written document. Script the promotion/rollback steps to reduce manual clicks, and document how to run the script."
