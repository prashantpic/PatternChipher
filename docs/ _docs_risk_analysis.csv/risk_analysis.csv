RISK-10-001,Technical,"The complex `if/then` conditional logic in the `LevelOutcomeEvent.json` schema (WI-101-103) is implemented incorrectly, leading to the acceptance of invalid data (e.g., `outcome=fail` with no `failure_reason`) or rejection of valid data.",4,4,16,High,"WI-101-103, WI-102-102",Inherent complexity of advanced JSON Schema features and potential for human error in logical implementation.,"Implement an exhaustive set of contract tests (as part of WI-102-102) specifically for `LevelOutcomeEvent.json`, covering all valid and invalid combinations of the `outcome` field and its conditionally required parameters.","If schema logic proves too brittle, simplify the data contract by splitting the event into three distinct events: `level_complete`, `level_fail`, and `level_quit`, each with its own simple, non-conditional schema.","The contract test suite for `LevelOutcomeEvent` fails. OR Post-launch data analysis in BigQuery reveals events with inconsistent data for the `outcome` field.",Schema Architect,2024-09-15,Open
RISK-10-002,Integration,"Custom event and parameter names/types registered in the Firebase Analytics Console (WI-104-101) have typos or type mismatches compared to the canonical JSON schemas, causing Firebase to drop or misinterpret incoming data.",4,5,20,High,"WI-104-101, EPIC-101","The configuration in the Firebase Console is a manual, error-prone process with no Infrastructure-as-Code capability for this specific feature.","Create a formal checklist derived directly from the JSON schemas for the Firebase setup task. Implement a two-person review-and-verify process for the manual configuration. Commit screenshots of the final configuration to the repository for audit purposes.","If data is missing post-launch, immediately perform a full audit of the Firebase Console configuration against the schemas. Accept data loss for the affected period and correct the configuration to prevent future loss.","After sending test events from a client, custom parameters do not appear for filtering in the Firebase Analytics console within 24 hours.",Firebase Admin,2024-09-30,Open
RISK-10-003,External,"A breaking change is made to a schema (e.g., renaming a field) but is not communicated effectively or the versioning strategy (WI-103-102) is not followed, causing client applications to send data in an old, now-invalid format.",3,4,16,High,"WI-103-102, REPO-PATT-001 (client)","Poor communication protocols between the schema provider team and the client implementation team; failure to adhere to the established SemVer governance process.","Strictly enforce the contribution and SemVer process via mandatory PR reviews that check for correct version bumps. Automate the generation of release notes that clearly label ""BREAKING CHANGES"". Maintain a shared communication channel with client teams for announcements.","Maintain older versions of schemas and create a backend data transformation layer (e.g., in BigQuery or a Cloud Function) to map old event formats to the new one for a limited period to ensure backward compatibility.","Monitoring of incoming data shows a sudden spike in validation errors for a specific event that correlates with a new client app release.",Lead Developer,2024-10-10,Open
RISK-10-004,Quality,"The contract test suite (WI-102-102) lacks coverage for edge cases (e.g., negative numbers for time, empty strings, nulls, unicode characters), allowing poor quality data to be ingested, which complicates downstream analysis in BigQuery.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-102-102",Test cases are focused on ""happy path"" validation rather than robust, defensive checking against potential client-side bugs or unexpected data.","As part of WI-102-102, create a formal test plan that includes a checklist of edge cases for each data type (numeric boundaries, string formats, etc.). Conduct a dedicated peer review of the test suite's coverage against this plan.","Implement data quality views or data cleaning scripts in BigQuery to flag or filter out records with nonsensical values (e.g., `WHERE time_taken_seconds < 0`) before they are used in dashboards or analysis.","A data analyst discovers unexpected or nonsensical values (e.g., negative `moves_taken`) in the raw BigQuery event table during routine analysis.",QA Lead,2024-09-20,Open
RISK-10-005,External,"The project is unable to correctly enforce compliance with COPPA/GDPR-K because the client-side logic for identifying child users is flawed or the Firebase SDK is not configured for ""child-directed treatment"", leading to potential legal and financial penalties.",2,5,10,Medium,"WI-104-101, SDS Section 3","Oversight in client-side implementation or Firebase project configuration; lack of a specific compliance verification step in the release process.","Incorporate a specific, mandatory ""Compliance Verification"" step into the client application's pre-release checklist. This step must include verifying the age gate logic and the correct initialization of the Firebase SDK with child-directed settings.","Establish a data incident response plan. If non-compliant data collection is discovered, immediately trigger the process to purge the affected data from all backend systems (Firebase, BigQuery) and notify the legal/compliance department.","An internal or external audit discovers that data collection practices do not align with the policies for users identified as children.",Compliance Officer,2024-10-15,Open
RISK-10-006,Technical,"The schema definitions drift from the implementation details of the client (`REPO-PATT-001`) over time, leading to a mismatch where the client sends data that is technically valid but semantically incorrect or incomplete from the perspective of the intended analysis.",3,3,9,Medium,"EPIC-101, EPIC-103","Ambiguity in the original Software Design Specification (SDS); lack of tight feedback loops between the data contract authors and the client developers.","Establish a process where the client development team (`REPO-PATT-001`) must review and formally approve any changes to the schemas via the Pull Request process. This ensures both sides agree on the contract.",Create a semantic validation layer or data quality monitoring dashboard in BigQuery that checks for logical inconsistencies (e.g., `stars_awarded` > 3) that would not be caught by schema validation alone.","Analysis shows logically inconsistent data patterns, such as a high number of `level_outcome` events with `outcome=complete` but `score=0`.",Product Manager,2024-10-05,Open
