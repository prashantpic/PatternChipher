TASK-ANA-001,Create and populate analytics_configuration.yaml,Data Engineering,YAML,Medium,3,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Requires meticulous attention to detail to avoid transcription errors. Can be performed by a mid-level data engineer or analyst.","Use a linter with a pre-commit hook during creation to catch syntax errors immediately."
TASK-ANA-002,Peer review analytics_configuration.yaml,Quality Assurance,YAML,Low,1,Senior,"1","TASK-ANA-001",Yes,"Must be performed by someone other than the author of TASK-ANA-001. A Tech Lead or senior data analyst is ideal.","If a formal schema could be defined for this YAML (e.g., using JSON Schema), an automated validation step could supplement the manual review."
TASK-ANA-003,Create and populate custom_events.json,Data Engineering,JSON,Medium,4,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Requires careful mapping of game concepts to a structured JSON format. A mid-level data engineer is suitable.","Generate the initial JSON structure from a more human-readable format like a spreadsheet or YAML to minimize syntax errors during creation."
TASK-ANA-004,Peer review custom_events.json,Quality Assurance,JSON,Low,2,Senior,"1","TASK-ANA-003",Yes,"Critical review that should involve both a data analyst (for meaning) and a client developer (for implementation feasibility).","For subsequent changes, use a diff tool that understands JSON structure to make reviews easier."
TASK-ANA-005,Create and populate user_properties.json,Data Engineering,JSON,Medium,3,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Similar to event creation, requires high attention to detail for correct data types and naming.","Generate from a shared spreadsheet or YAML file that both data analysts and developers can easily read and comment on."
TASK-ANA-006,Peer review user_properties.json,Quality Assurance,JSON,Low,1,Senior,"1","TASK-ANA-005",Yes,"Must be reviewed by a lead or senior engineer, ideally with input from the data analysis team.","N/A for a manual review task."
TASK-ANA-007,Create and populate privacy_compliance_map.json,Data Engineering,Compliance,High,7,Senior,"1","TASK-ANA-003,TASK-ANA-005",Yes,"Extremely high attention to detail required. A checklist approach is recommended to ensure no parameter is missed. A senior resource is needed due to the compliance-critical nature.","Generate a template for this file using a script that pre-populates all keys from the other JSON files, requiring the developer only to fill in the compliance value."
TASK-ANA-008,Peer review privacy_compliance_map.json,Quality Assurance,Compliance,Medium,3,Lead,"1","TASK-ANA-007",Yes,"This review is mission-critical and must be done by a Tech Lead. In a real-world scenario, a compliance officer might also be required for sign-off.","The primary alternative is the automated check in TASK-ANA-012, which this manual task aims to precede. The review should focus on the logic, not just the presence of keys."
TASK-ANA-009,Research and select linters for CI,DevOps,CI/CD,Low,2,Mid,1,"",Yes,"A mid-level DevOps engineer can research and propose standard, well-supported linters for YAML and JSON from the GitHub Actions marketplace.","To reduce research time, default to using a pre-packaged 'super-linter' that handles many file types, and only research alternatives if it proves insufficient."
TASK-ANA-010,Implement CI workflow for YAML/JSON linting,DevOps,CI/CD,Medium,4,Mid,"1","TASK-ANA-009",Yes,"A mid-level DevOps engineer comfortable with GitHub Actions syntax can implement this.","Use a pre-built, reusable workflow from a central organizational repository if one exists, to ensure consistency across projects."
TASK-ANA-011,Test linting workflow with invalid files,DevOps,Quality Assurance,Low,2,Mid,"1","TASK-ANA-010",Yes,"Can be performed by the same DevOps engineer who implemented the workflow.","Instead of a full test PR, use a tool like 'act' to run the GitHub Actions workflow locally to get faster feedback."
TASK-ANA-012,Design and write core logic for consistency script,Backend Development,Python,High,12,Senior,"1","TASK-ANA-008",Yes,"Requires a senior developer with strong Python scripting and logic skills. Could be a Data Engineer or a Backend Dev. This is a high-complexity task with estimation risk.","Explore using JSON Schema definitions and a validator library that can handle cross-references, which might be more standard but have a steeper learning curve."
TASK-ANA-013,Write unit tests for the validation script,Backend Development,Quality Assurance,High,8.5,Senior,"1","TASK-ANA-012",Yes,"Best performed by the same senior developer who wrote the script, as they have the most context. Requires a strong testing mindset to cover all edge cases.","Pair programming during the development of TASK-ANA-012 could improve initial quality and reduce the time required for a separate testing task."
TASK-ANA-014,Integrate consistency script into CI pipeline,DevOps,CI/CD,Medium,4,Mid,"1","TASK-ANA-012,TASK-ANA-010",Yes,"A mid-level DevOps engineer can add the script execution step to the existing GitHub Actions workflow.","The validation script could be packaged into a self-contained Docker image, which can simplify the CI setup and ensure a consistent execution environment."
TASK-ANA-015,End-to-end test of consistency check in CI,DevOps,Quality Assurance,Low,3,Mid,"1","TASK-ANA-014",Yes,"Requires a test PR with deliberate inconsistencies to ensure the pipeline fails as expected. The DevOps engineer can execute this test.","N/A, this is a required final validation step for the automation feature."
TASK-ANA-016,Draft content for README.md,Product Management,"Technical Writing",Medium,4,Senior,"1","",No,"Best assigned to a Tech Lead or Product Manager who has a holistic view of the repository's purpose and can communicate it clearly.","Auto-generate sections of the README (like file descriptions) from comments within the schema files to keep documentation synchronized with the code."
TASK-ANA-017,Review and refine README.md,Quality Assurance,"Technical Writing",Low,2.5,Mid,"1","TASK-ANA-016",No,"Reviewer should be someone who is a target user of the documentation, such as a new developer or a data analyst, to ensure clarity.","N/A for a manual review task."
TASK-ANA-018,Draft content for CONTRIBUTING.md,Product Management,"Technical Writing",Medium,3,Lead,"1","",No,"Tech Lead is the ideal owner, as they are responsible for defining the team's engineering processes and standards.","Base the document on a standard open-source contribution guide (e.g., from contributing.md template) and adapt it to the project's specific needs."
TASK-ANA-019,Review and get sign-off on CONTRIBUTING.md,Product Management,Communication,Low,2,Mid,"1","TASK-ANA-018",No,"This is a coordination task. A Product Manager or team lead can facilitate the review process to ensure all key stakeholders (dev, data, QA leads) agree.","Conduct a short (30 min) meeting with all leads to walk through the document and get verbal sign-off, which is often faster than asynchronous review for process documents."
