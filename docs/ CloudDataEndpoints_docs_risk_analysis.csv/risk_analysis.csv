Implement comprehensive unit tests (WI-CDS-008) covering all allowed and denied scenarios with a target coverage of >95%. Use static analysis tools for security rules if available.","Immediately deploy a fully restrictive ruleset (`allow read, write: if false;`) to halt access. Initiate incident response plan. Use PITR backups (WI-CDS-004) to restore data if corruption occurred. Analyze Firestore logs to identify scope of unauthorized access.","Unit test failures in CI/CD pipeline. Spike in 'DENY' evaluations in Firestore Security Rules monitoring dashboard. Security audit finding.",Lead Backend Engineer,,Open
R02,Quality,"Incomplete or ambiguous strategy documentation (Conflict Resolution, Sync Triggers) leads to incorrect client-side implementation, causing user data loss or a poor user experience.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-CDS-005, WI-CDS-006","Technical writer's misunderstanding of system edge cases; failure to clearly define complex user flows like the ""initial sync prompt"".","Conduct a joint review session of the strategy documents involving both the document author and the client development team lead. Include clear flowcharts or sequence diagrams for complex interactions. Add a 'Common Pitfalls' section to the documents.","If data loss issues are reported, prioritize a client-side patch. Use analytics to identify users who may have been affected. Provide in-app messaging to guide users through potential manual recovery steps if applicable.","Client-side QA testing reveals inconsistencies with the documented strategy. User bug reports related to lost progress after syncing.",Product Manager,,Open
R03,Quality,"The unit tests for security rules (WI-CDS-008) are incomplete and do not cover critical edge cases (e.g., different data types, nested object validation), allowing a security vulnerability to pass testing and be deployed.",3,5,15,High,"WI-CDS-008, WI-CDS-009","Developer rushing to complete tests; lack of understanding of all potential attack vectors; failure to test against all fields in the schema with both valid and invalid data.","Enforce a test coverage threshold (>95%) in the CI/CD pipeline that fails the build if not met. Create a test plan checklist before writing code, covering: authenticated user (own/other data), unauthenticated user, valid/invalid schema for each field, and list operations.","If a test coverage gap is found post-deployment, treat it as a P1 bug. Immediately schedule work to add the missing tests. Manually review the live rules for the vulnerability while tests are being written. Follow R01 contingency if a flaw is confirmed.","Test coverage reports fall below the threshold. A manual code review discovers an untested scenario. A security vulnerability is found in production that should have been caught by tests.",QA Lead,,Open
R04,Operational,"The CI/CD pipeline for deploying Firestore configurations is misconfigured, leading to failed deployments or deploying untested artifacts to production.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-CDS-009,"Incorrectly configured YAML workflow file; insecure management of Firebase service account credentials; deployment job not dependent on test job success.","Implement the CI/CD pipeline to deploy to a staging environment first. Require a manual approval step to promote the deployment to production. Store service account credentials as encrypted secrets in the CI/CD system. Ensure the 'deploy' job explicitly depends on the 'test' job succeeding.","Maintain a documented manual rollback procedure using the Firebase CLI. If a bad deployment occurs, immediately re-run the pipeline with the last known good commit. Implement pipeline failure alerts to a dedicated DevOps channel.","CI/CD workflow execution fails. Post-deployment monitoring shows unexpected behavior. Manual verification in the Firebase console shows rules haven't been updated.",DevOps Lead,,Open
R05,Resource,"Lack of developer expertise with the Firestore Security Rules language and its testing framework (`@firebase/rules-unit-testing`) leads to significant delays and poor quality implementation.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-CDS-002, WI-CDS-008","Key person dependency; insufficient training for the assigned developer; underestimation of the niche skills required for declarative, security-focused programming.","Allocate budget and time for training on Firebase technologies. Ensure more than one developer is familiar with the rules and testing setup (e.g., via pair programming). Use official Firebase documentation and examples as a primary resource.","Engage a short-term external consultant with Firebase expertise to review the implementation or assist with complex parts. Re-allocate a more experienced developer to the task if slippage becomes critical.","Velocity on security-related tasks (WI-CDS-002, WI-CDS-008) is significantly lower than estimated. Initial pull requests show a lack of understanding of the security model.",Engineering Manager,,Open
R06,Operational,"The Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) feature is not enabled on the production Firestore database, or the recovery procedure is not tested, resulting in an inability to recover from catastrophic data loss.",2,5,10,Medium,WI-CDS-004,"Oversight during infrastructure provisioning; treating the backup policy document as sufficient without implementing the technical controls; de-prioritizing non-functional requirements like disaster recovery drills.","Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) to provision the Firestore database, which explicitly enables PITR. Add 'Verify PITR is enabled' as a step in the production deployment checklist. Schedule and conduct the semi-annual recovery drills as mandated by the policy.","In case of data loss without PITR, the only option is to restore from the last manual or scheduled export (if any were configured), leading to a significant RPO (potentially days or weeks). This is a major incident scenario with likely permanent data loss.","Periodic audit of GCP project settings shows PITR is disabled. A recovery drill fails or cannot be completed within the RTO.",DevOps Lead,,Open
R07,Timeline,"The high complexity and effort estimation for key tasks (WI-CDS-002, WI-CDS-008, WI-CDS-009) are inaccurate, leading to a schedule overrun that delays dependent features like Cloud Save.",4,3,12,Medium,"EPIC-CDS-001, EPIC-CDS-003","Underestimation of the time required to learn technology nuances, write comprehensive tests, and debug the CI/CD pipeline for a configuration-based repository.","Break down the high-complexity tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks with individual estimates. Timebox initial research and prototyping spikes. Track effort spent against estimates closely to allow for early re-forecasting.","If slippage is detected early, de-scope non-critical parts of the initial implementation (e.g., a less complex schema validation). Re-prioritize work to ensure the most critical path is unblocked. Communicate revised timeline expectations to stakeholders immediately.","Weekly progress reviews show a task is consuming more than 150% of its estimated effort. Developer reports being blocked or struggling with a task for more than a day.",Project Manager,,Open
R08,External,"A breaking change is introduced in the Firebase Emulator Suite, the `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` library, or the security rules language itself, which breaks the local testing environment or the deployed rules.",2,4,8,Medium,"WI-CDS-007, WI-CDS-008, WI-CDS-009","Dependency on external, third-party software and services which are outside the project's control.","Pin dependency versions in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to avoid automatic updates to new major versions. Use a tool like Dependabot to be notified of updates, but require manual review and testing in a separate branch before upgrading.","If a breaking change occurs, freeze deployments of new rules. Dedicate developer time to refactor the tests or rules to be compatible with the new version. If a rollback of the dependency is possible, do that as a temporary fix.","CI/CD build starts failing after a dependency update. Local development environment breaks after running `npm install`. Firebase service health dashboard reports an issue or upcoming breaking change.",Lead Backend Engineer,,Open
R09,Technical,"The schema validation function `validateUserProfileV1` in `firestore.rules` is too rigid (e.g., checks for an exact number of keys), making future schema additions difficult and risky without creating a new version.",4,2,8,Medium,"WI-CDS-002, WI-CDS-001","Designing the validation function for the exact current schema instead of designing for future extensibility.","Design the validation function to allow for optional, unknown fields. For example, instead of checking for `data.keys().size()`, only check for the presence of required fields. Use the documented `user_profile_schema_version` field to create new validation functions for future breaking changes.","If a schema change is needed and the rules are too rigid, a new validation function (`validateUserProfileV2`) must be written. The rules must be updated to check the incoming version and call the appropriate validation function. This requires a coordinated client and backend deployment.","A new feature requires adding an optional field to the `UserProfile`, and analysis shows it will break the existing security rule validation.",Lead Backend Engineer,,Open
