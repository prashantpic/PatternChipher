T01,"Create UserProfile.md Schema Document",Technical Writing,"Data Modeling, Markdown",Medium,12.8,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Requires meticulous attention to detail to match the SDS. Forms the basis for security rules and client-side implementation.","Could be assigned to a dedicated technical writer or a product manager with technical skills to free up developer capacity."
T02,"Create Placeholder firestore.indexes.json",Backend Development,"JSON, Firestore",Low,4.8,Junior,1,"",No,"Simple configuration task. Good for a new team member to get familiar with the repository structure.","Bundle with another Firestore configuration task."
T03,"Document Backup and Recovery Policy",Technical Writing,"DevOps, GCP/Firebase",Medium,12.8,Mid,1,"",No,"Requires understanding of Firebase/GCP's PITR feature and defining realistic RPO/RTO. Should be reviewed by a DevOps lead.","Can be written by a DevOps Engineer and reviewed by a PM for clarity."
T04,"Document Cloud Save Sync Triggers",Technical Writing,"Game Design, System Design",Medium,13.2,Mid,1,"",No,"Requires collaboration with game designers and client developers to define user-friendly and efficient sync points.","Can be drafted by a Product Manager and refined by a developer."
T05,"Draft firestore.rules for User Data Isolation",Backend Development,"Firestore Security Rules Language, Security",Medium,16.8,Senior,1,"T01",Yes,"Critical security task. Requires a developer with strong understanding of declarative security models and Firebase Auth integration.","Use pair programming to ensure quality and knowledge sharing on this critical component."
T06,"Document Conflict Resolution Strategy",Technical Writing,"System Design",Medium,16.8,Mid,1,"T01",No,"Complex strategy that must be documented clearly for client developers. Flowcharts or sequence diagrams would be beneficial.","Can be co-authored by a backend and client lead developer to ensure alignment."
T07,"Implement Schema Validation Function in Rules",Backend Development,"Firestore Security Rules Language, Security",High,25.2,Senior,1,"T05",Yes,"Most complex part of security rules. Requires deep validation of a nested object structure and server timestamps. High risk of error.","Timebox a research spike. Use pair programming with another senior developer for review and implementation."
T08,"Finalize Rules with Global Denies",Backend Development,"Firestore Security Rules Language, Security",Low,8.0,Mid,1,"T07",Yes,"Simple but critical task to ensure a fail-safe security posture. Should be part of a final security review checklist.","Incorporate into the previous task (T07) as a final step."
T09,"Setup Node.js Project with Firebase Emulator and Jest",DevOps,"Testing, Firebase Emulator Suite, TypeScript",High,20.8,Senior,1,"T08",Yes,"Foundation for all automated testing. Requires a developer comfortable with tooling, configuration, and build scripts. A DevOps specialist is ideal.","Find a boilerplate or example project from Firebase documentation to accelerate setup."
T10,"Develop Test Helpers and Mock Data",Backend Development,"Jest, TypeScript, Testing",Medium,16.0,Mid,1,"T09",Yes,"Crucial for writing clean and maintainable tests. Good planning here will speed up subsequent test writing tasks.","Can be pair-programmed with the developer who will write the bulk of the tests."
T11,"Implement Tests for Read/Delete and Data Isolation",Quality Assurance,"Jest, TypeScript, Firestore Security Rules",Medium,16.8,Mid,1,"T10",Yes,"Covers the core data isolation principle. Tests should check authenticated owner, authenticated other, and unauthenticated scenarios.","Can be parallelized with tasks T12 and T13 if multiple developers are available."
T12,"Implement Tests for Create Operation and Validation",Quality Assurance,"Jest, TypeScript, Firestore Security Rules",High,24.8,Senior,1,"T10",Yes,"Complex test case generation required to cover all schema validation failure paths. Needs a systematic approach to creating invalid data payloads.","Can be parallelized with tasks T11 and T13. Pair programming could help generate comprehensive test cases."
T13,"Implement Tests for Update Operation and Validation",Quality Assurance,"Jest, TypeScript, Firestore Security Rules",High,20.0,Senior,1,"T10",Yes,"Similar to Create tests, but must also cover cases like trying to update another user's document. Requires setting up initial state before running tests.","Can be parallelized with tasks T11 and T12."
T14,"Finalize Test Suite and Measure Coverage",Quality Assurance,Jest,Medium,12.8,Mid,1,"T11,T12,T13",Yes,"Focuses on achieving the quality gate (>90% coverage). May involve writing small tests to cover missed edge cases.","Assign to a QA Automation specialist to review and finalize."
T15,"Configure GitHub Actions Workflow for Testing",DevOps,"CI/CD (GitHub Actions), YAML",High,25.2,Senior,1,"T14",Yes,"Requires expertise in GitHub Actions, including service containers or setup steps for the Firebase emulator. Can be tricky to debug.","Start with a standard Node.js workflow and incrementally add Firebase emulator steps."
T16,"Add Staging Deployment Job to CI/CD Workflow",DevOps,"CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Firebase CLI",High,34.0,Lead,1,"T15",Yes,"Highest complexity due to managing environments, secrets, and deployment dependencies. Requires a lead-level DevOps engineer.","For a simpler setup, start with manual deployments from a developer machine using a script, and automate later."
