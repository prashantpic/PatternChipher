TASK-AUTH-001-1,"Create and populate firebase/auth/authentication.config.json",Backend Development,"JSON,Firebase Authentication",Low,1.5,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Requires clear understanding of the SDS. Relates to deployment risks (RISK-AUTH-002) and potential service changes (RISK-AUTH-006).","If schema is unclear, create a minimal viable configuration and iterate with the team."
TASK-AUTH-001-2,"Peer review and merge authentication.config.json",Quality Assurance,"JSON,Firebase Authentication",Low,1.5,Senior,1,TASK-AUTH-001-1,Yes,"Reviewer must be intimately familiar with the SDS. This review is a key mitigation for manual deployment errors (RISK-AUTH-002).","If a designated lead is unavailable, another senior backend developer can perform the review to maintain velocity."
TASK-AUTH-002-1,"Draft Google Sign-In setup guide section",Design,"Technical Writing,Google Cloud Platform,Firebase",Medium,6,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Author needs dedicated access to a Google Cloud Platform project. Document is susceptible to UI changes in the GCP portal (RISK-AUTH-001).","If direct access is unavailable, use official Google documentation and screenshots as a temporary measure, noting that the guide is unverified."
TASK-AUTH-002-2,"Peer review Google Sign-In guide draft",Quality Assurance,"Technical Writing,Google Cloud Platform",Low,2.5,Senior,1,TASK-AUTH-002-1,Yes,"Reviewer should have familiarity with GCP or strong analytical skills to identify logical gaps in the instructions.","Split the review: have a developer with GCP experience verify technical steps, and a product manager or writer review for clarity and formatting."
TASK-AUTH-003-1,"Draft Apple Sign-In setup guide section",Design,"Technical Writing,Apple Developer Portal,Xcode",Medium,6,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Author requires full access to a valid Apple Developer Program account. High risk of external dependency issues (RISK-AUTH-001, RISK-AUTH-007).","Contingency for lack of account access (RISK-AUTH-007): Author uses official Apple documentation and screenshots, with a clear disclaimer that the guide is unvalidated."

TASK-AUTH-004-1,"Perform hands-on validation (dry-run) of Google Sign-In guide",Quality Assurance,"Google Cloud Platform,Firebase",Medium,4.5,Mid,1,TASK-AUTH-002-1,Yes,"Validator must be a different person than the author to ensure an unbiased test. Addresses validation quality risk (RISK-AUTH-004). A clean test project is required.","If a dedicated validator is unavailable, the author can perform a live screen-sharing session with another developer who acts as the ""driver"" to talk through the steps."
TASK-AUTH-004-2,"Perform hands-on validation (dry-run) of Apple Sign-In guide",Quality Assurance,"Apple Developer Portal,Xcode,Firebase",Medium,4.5,Mid,1,TASK-AUTH-003-1,Yes,"Validator must be different from the author and requires Apple Developer account access. Addresses risks RISK-AUTH-001, RISK-AUTH-004, and RISK-AUTH-007.","If a dedicated validator with an Apple account is unavailable, use the first client developer who needs to perform the setup as the validator, providing them direct support."

TASK-AUTH-005-1,"Draft firebase/auth/compliance.policy.md",Product Management,"Technical Writing,Compliance Knowledge (COPPA/GDPR-K)",Medium,3,Senior,1,"",Yes,"Author must have a clear understanding of the legal requirements outlined in the SDS. This is the first step in mitigating legal risk (RISK-AUTH-003).","If one person lacks both skills, have the Product Owner draft the core policy points/rules, and a Technical Writer will then formalize the language and structure."
TASK-AUTH-005-2,"Facilitate formal review of compliance policy with stakeholders",Product Management,"Communication,Stakeholder Management",Medium,4.5,Lead,1,TASK-AUTH-005-1,Yes,"High risk of timeline delays due to stakeholder unavailability (RISK-AUTH-005). This meeting is the key mitigation step for policy misinterpretation (RISK-AUTH-003).","Contingency for RISK-AUTH-005: Proceed with client-side development based on the draft policy, but the feature must be disabled by a feature flag until final sign-off is received."
TASK-AUTH-005-3,"Incorporate feedback and merge final compliance policy",Product Management,"Technical Writing,Markdown",Low,2,Senior,1,TASK-AUTH-005-2,Yes,"Assumes feedback from review is minor and does not require a significant rewrite or another full review cycle.","If feedback is major, this task should be converted back to a 'Draft' task and re-enter the review cycle, with the timeline risk being escalated."
TASK-AUTH-006-1,"Create and populate repository README.md",Design,"Technical Writing,Markdown",Low,1.5,Junior,1,"",No,"Standard documentation task to improve developer onboarding.","If a technical writer is unavailable, use a template and have the lead developer populate the essential details."
