TASK-CLIENT-006,Implement AppInitializer.cs Script Logic,Frontend Development,DevOps,Low,4,Mid,1,"TASK-CLIENT-002,TASK-CLIENT-020",Yes,"Requires access to the GameManager prefab. The logic is simple but foundational for the app's startup sequence.","Combine initializer logic directly into a special bootstrap method within the GameManager to reduce the number of bootstrapping scripts."
TASK-CLIENT-024,Review AppInitializer Script,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Low,2.5,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-006,Yes,"Review should be done by a developer other than the original author. Focus on race conditions with other potential Awake() methods.","Incorporate this review into a larger review of the entire bootstrapping process, including the GameManager prefab setup."
TASK-CLIENT-002,Implement GameManager Singleton Pattern,Frontend Development,DevOps,High,7,Senior,1,"",Yes,"Critical architecture task with high risk (RISK-TEC-001). Requires deep knowledge of Unity's object lifecycle. The developer should be experienced with singleton pitfalls in Unity.","Use a Service Locator pattern instead of a singleton to reduce global state coupling and improve testability."
TASK-CLIENT-007,Write Play Mode Tests for GameManager Singleton Persistence,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Medium,6.5,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-002,Yes,"Tests must simulate scene transitions to be effective. This requires a multi-scene test setup within the Unity Test Framework.","Create a single, comprehensive ""Core Systems"" test scene that can be used to validate the GameManager, SceneLoader, and EventSystem interactions together."
TASK-CLIENT-003,Implement GameManager Lifecycle Hooks for Data Persistence,Frontend Development,Backend Development,Medium,3.5,Mid,1,"TASK-CLIENT-002",Yes,"Depends on the IPersistenceService interface being defined (RISK-TIM-001). Development should proceed using a mock interface.","Use the GameEventSystem to publish `ApplicationPausedEvent` and `ApplicationQuitEvent`, allowing the Persistence service to subscribe and handle saving, decoupling it from the GameManager."
TASK-CLIENT-009,Review GameManager Singleton and Lifecycle Code,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,High,4,Senior,1,"TASK-CLIENT-002,TASK-CLIENT-003,TASK-CLIENT-008",Yes,"This is a major review covering multiple critical tasks and should be treated as a key quality gate. Reviewer should be a senior dev, ideally the tech lead.","Break the review into smaller parts: one for the singleton pattern, one for lifecycle hooks, and one for the state machine, to make it more manageable."
TASK-CLIENT-008,Implement GameManager State Machine Core Logic,Frontend Development,Design,High,8.5,Senior,1,"TASK-CLIENT-001,TASK-CLIENT-002,TASK-CLIENT-011,TASK-CLIENT-015",Yes,"High-risk task (RISK-QLT-001). The implementation must be robust, especially the OnExitState logic to prevent state corruption.","Use a third-party, battle-tested State Machine library (e.g., Stateless) instead of a manual switch-statement implementation to reduce boilerplate and potential bugs."
TASK-CLIENT-010,Write Play Mode Tests for State Machine Transitions,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,High,9.5,Senior,1,TASK-CLIENT-008,Yes,"Requires complex test setup to mock scene loading and listen for events. The QA engineer needs strong C# and Unity Test Framework skills.","Develop an in-game debug menu that allows testers to manually trigger state changes, providing a faster, more flexible way to test state transitions manually."
TASK-CLIENT-016,Review State Machine Code,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Medium,2,Senior,1,TASK-CLIENT-008,Yes,"The reviewer must have a solid understanding of the State Machine pattern and its interaction with the async SceneLoader.","Perform a pair programming session to implement the state machine instead of a post-implementation review, catching logical errors earlier."
TASK-CLIENT-001,Create GameState.cs and SceneId.cs enum files,Frontend Development,,Low,2,Junior,1,"",Yes,"Simple but critical task as many other systems depend on these type-safe definitions. Prone to typos if not done carefully.","Generate these enums automatically from a configuration file or an editor script that scans the Build Settings to prevent manual synchronization errors (RISK-TEC-003)."
TASK-CLIENT-011,Implement static GameEventSystem,Frontend Development,Backend Development,High,5,Senior,1,"",Yes,"Core architectural component. High risk of memory leaks if subscriptions are not managed carefully (RISK-PER-001). Requires senior-level C# knowledge.","Use a pre-existing message bus/event system from the Unity Asset Store or a library like UniRx (Reactive Extensions) to leverage a battle-tested solution."
TASK-CLIENT-012,Write Edit Mode Tests for GameEventSystem,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-011,Yes,"Tests must verify subscription, publication, and unsubscription logic, including edge cases like publishing to a topic with no listeners.","Instead of pure unit tests, create an integration test that uses the event bus to communicate between two simple mock components to test the full lifecycle."
TASK-CLIENT-013,Review GameEventSystem Implementation,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Medium,2.5,Senior,1,TASK-CLIENT-011,Yes,"Review must focus on memory management (delegate handling, dictionary cleanup) and potential for race conditions if multithreading were ever introduced.","Use a static analysis tool to automatically scan for common issues like unmanaged event subscriptions before the manual review."
TASK-CLIENT-015,Create CoreGameEvents.cs with Event Structs,Frontend Development,Data Engineering,Low,2,Junior,1,"",Yes,"Straightforward task, but the data contracts defined here are fundamental to inter-system communication. Clarity and consistency are key.","Define event contracts in a shared format like JSON schema, and then generate the C# structs from that schema to ensure consistency with other potential consumers."
TASK-CLIENT-004,Implement SceneLoader.cs Utility,Frontend Development,Design,Medium,6.5,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-001,Yes,"Requires solid understanding of C# async/await and Unity's SceneManager. High risk of async-related bugs and visual glitches (RISK-QLT-002).","Wrap the SceneLoader in a ""TransitionService"" that also manages fade-in/fade-out animations, creating a single point of control for all screen transitions."
TASK-CLIENT-014,Write Play Mode Tests for SceneLoader,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Medium,5.5,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-015,Yes,"The dependency listed is likely a typo for TASK-CLIENT-004. Test must be a Play Mode test and will involve loading actual, lightweight test scenes.","Create a test suite that chains multiple scene loads together to check for memory leaks or corrupted state between transitions."
TASK-CLIENT-017,Review SceneLoader Implementation,Quality assurance,Frontend Development,Medium,2.5,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-015,Yes,"The dependency listed is likely a typo for TASK-CLIENT-004. Review should focus on correct async pattern usage and error handling for failed scene loads.","Review the code in conjunction with the UI loading screen implementation to ensure the interaction points are robust."
TASK-CLIENT-018,Create and Configure PatternCipher.Client.asmdef,DevOps,Frontend Development,Medium,3.5,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Critical for architecture enforcement (RISK-TEC-002). This task requires a developer with an understanding of Unity's compilation pipeline and the project's layered architecture.","Automate the creation and validation of .asmdef files via a CI script to ensure they always match the architectural design document."
TASK-CLIENT-019,Review .asmdef Configuration,DevOps,Quality Assurance,Low,1,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-018,Yes,"Simple validation task. A second pair of eyes to check off the reference list against the SDS.","Instead of a manual review, use a CI script that parses the .asmdef file and compares its references against a list defined in a config file, failing the build on mismatch."
TASK-CLIENT-020,Create and Configure GameManager Prefab,Frontend Development,DevOps,Low,3.5,Mid,1,"TASK-CLIENT-002,TASK-CLIENT-015",Yes,"A configuration task that can be a source of hard-to-find bugs if references are missing. All [SerializeField] fields must be assigned.","Write an Editor script that can validate the prefab, checking that all required references are non-null, and run this as a pre-commit hook."
TASK-CLIENT-021,Review GameManager Prefab,Quality Assurance,Frontend Development,Low,0.5,Junior,1,TASK-CLIENT-020,Yes,"Quick but necessary sanity check to prevent runtime NullReferenceExceptions.","The developer doing the review can simply instantiate the prefab in a test scene to confirm it doesn't throw errors on Awake()."
TASK-CLIENT-022,Create and Configure Bootstrap.unity Scene,Frontend Development,DevOps,Low,3,Mid,1,"TASK-CLIENT-006,TASK-CLIENT-020",Yes,"This scene acts as the single entry point for the application. Its configuration is simple but absolutely critical.","Create a ""Bootstrap"" prefab that contains the configured AppInitializer GameObject, and have a CI script place this prefab in a blank scene to generate the bootstrap scene automatically."
TASK-CLIENT-023,Configure Unity Build Settings,DevOps,Quality Assurance,Low,2,Mid,1,TASK-CLIENT-022,Yes,"High operational risk due to manual process (RISK-OPR-001). The person performing this task must be meticulous.","Write a Unity Editor script (invoked by CI) that programmatically sets the build scenes, ensuring the Bootstrap scene is always at index 0."
